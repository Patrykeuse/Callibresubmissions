\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Darrick Lang pulled at the oar and scanned the night-shrouded cliffs overlooking the Dyre River, hoping he remained out of sight of the pirates they hunted. Of course, he would only know they\'92d been discovered after the initial attack, and the pirates weren\'92t known for their generosity toward Westmarch navy sailors. Especially ones who were hunting them pursuant to the King of Westmarch\'92s standing orders. The possibility of getting caught wasn\'92t a pleasant thought.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 The longboat sculled against the gentle current, but the prow cut so clean that the water didn\'92t slap against the low hull. Sentries posted up on the surrounding cliffs would raise the alarm if the longboat were seen or heard, and there would be absolute hell to pay for it. If that happened, Darrick was certain none of them would make it back to\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star\plain \f2\fs24 waiting out in the Gulf of Westmarch. Captain Tollifer, the vessel\'92s master, was one of the sharpest naval commanders in all of Westmarch under the king\'92s command, and he\'92d have no problem shipping out if Darrick and his band didn\'92t return before dawn.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Bending his back and leaning forward, Darrick eased the oar from the water and spoke in a soft voice. \'93Easy, boys. Steady on, and we\'92ll make a go of this. We\'92ll be in and out before those damned pirates know we\'92ve come and gone.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93If our luck holds,\'94 Mat Hu-Ring whispered beside Darrick.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ll take luck,\'94 Darrick replied. \'93Never had anything against it, and it seems you\'92ve always had plenty to spare.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You\'92ve never been one to go a-courtin\'92 luck,\'94 Mat said.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Never,\'94 Darrick agreed, feeling a little cocky in spite of the danger they were facing. \'93But I don\'92t find myself forgetting friends who have it.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Is that why you brought me along on this little venture of yours?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye,\'94 Darrick replied. \'93And as I got it toted, I saved your life the last time. I\'92m figuring you owe me one there.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat grinned in the darkness, and the white of his teeth split his dark face. Like Darrick, he wore lampblack to shadow his features and make him more a part of the night. But where Darrick had reddish hair and bronze skin, Mat had black hair and was nut brown.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Oh, but you\'92re up and bound to be pushin\'92 luck this night, aren\'92t you, my friend?\'94 Mat asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The fog is holding.\'94 Darrick nodded at the billowing silver-gray gusts that stayed low over the river. The wind and the water worked together tonight, and the fog rolled out to the sea. With the fog in the way, the distance seemed even farther. \'93Mayhap we can rely on the weather more than we have to rely on your luck.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93An\'92 if ye keep runnin\'92 yer mouths the way ye are,\'94 old Maldrin snarled in his gruff voice, \'93mayhap them guards what ain\'92t sleepin\'92 up there will hear ye and let go with some of them ambushes these damned pirates has got set up.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye,\'94 Darrick agreed. \'93An\'92 I know the sound don\'92t carry up to them cliffs from here. They\'92re a good forty feet above us, they are.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Stupid Hillsfar outlander,\'94 Maldrin growled. \'93Ye\'92re still wet behind the ears and runnin\'92 at the nose for carryin\'92 out this here kind of work. If\'92n ye ask me, ol\'92 Cap\'92n Tollifer ain\'92t quite plump off the bob these days.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93An\'92 there you have it then, Ship\'92s Mate Maldrin,\'94 Darrick said. \'93No one bloody asked you.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A couple of the other men aboard the longboat laughed at the old mate\'92s expense. Although Maldrin had a reputation as a fierce sailor and warrior, the younger men on the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint5}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint5}crew considered him somewhat of a mother hen and a worrywart.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The first mate was a short man but possessed shoulders almost an ax handle\'92s length across. He kept his gray-streaked beard cropped close. A horseshoe-shaped bald spot left him smooth on top but with plenty of hair on the sides and in back that he tied in a queue. Moisture from the river and the fog glistened on the tarred breeches and soaked the dark shirt.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick and the other men in the longboat were clad in similar fashion. All of them had wrapped their blades in spare bits of sailcloth to keep the moonshine and water from them. The Dyre River was fresh water, not the corrosive salt of the Gulf of Westmarch, but a sailor\'92s practices in the King\'92s Royal Navy were hard to put aside.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Insolent pup,\'94 Maldrin muttered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Ah, and you love me for it even as you decry it, Maldrin,\'94 Darrick said. \'93If you think you\'92re miserable company now, just think about how you\'92d have been if I\'92d up and bloody left you on board\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star.\plain \f2\fs24 I\'92m telling you, man, I don\'92t see you up for a night of hand-wringing.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93This isn\'92t going to be as easy as ye seem to want to believe,\'94 Maldrin said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And what\'92s to worry about, Maldrin? A few pirates?\'94 Darrick shipped his oar, watchful that the longboat crew still moved together, then eased it back into the water and drew again. The longboat surged through the river water, making good time. They\'92d spotted the small campfire of the first sentry a quarter-mile back. The port they were looking for wasn\'92t much farther ahead.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93These aren\'92t just any pirates,\'94 Maldrin replied.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Darrick said, \'93I have to agree with you. These here pirates, now these are the ones that Cap\'92n Tollifer sent us to fetch up some trouble with. After orders like them, I won\'92t have you thinking I\'92d just settle for any pirates.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Nor me,\'94 Mat put in. \'93I\'92ve proven myself right choosy when it comes to fighting the likes of pirates.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint6}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint6}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A few of the other men agreed, and they shared a slight laugh.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  No one, Darrick noted, mentioned anything of the boy the pirates had kidnapped. Since the boy\'92s body hadn\'92t been recovered at the site of the earlier attack, everyone believed he was being held for ransom. Despite the need to let off steam before their insertion into the pirates\'92 stronghold, thinking of the boy was sobering.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Maldrin only shook his head and turned his attention to his own oar. \'93Ach, an\'92 ye\'92re a proper pain in the arse, Darrick Lang. Before all that\'92s of the Light and holy, I\'92d swear to that. But if\'92n there\'92s a man aboard Cap\'92n Tollifer\'92s ship what can pull this off, I figure it\'92s gotta be you.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92d doff my hat to you, Maldrin,\'94 Darrick said, touched. \'93If I were wearing one, that is.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Just keep wearin\'92 the head it would fit on if ye were,\'94 Maldrin growled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Indeed,\'94 Darrick said. \'93I intend to.\'94 He took a fresh grip on his oar. \'93Pull, then, boys, while the river is steady and the fog stays with us.\'94 As he gazed up at the mountains, he knew that some savage part of him relished thoughts of the coming battle.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The pirates wouldn\'92t give the boy back for free. And Captain Tollifer, on behalf of Westmarch\'92s king, was demanding a blood price as well.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Damned fog,\'94 Raithen said, then swore with heartfelt emotion.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The pirate captain\'92s vehemence drew Buyard Cholik from his reverie. The old priest blinked past the fatigue that held him in thrall and glanced at the burly man who stood limned in the torchlight coming from the suite of rooms inside the building. \'93What is the matter, Captain Raithen?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen stood like a mountain at the stone balcony railing of the building that overlooked the alabaster and columned ruins of the small port city where they\'92d been encamped for months. He pulled at the goatee covering his{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint7}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint7}massive chin and absently touched the cruel scar on the right corner of his mouth that gave him a cold leer.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The fog. Makes it damned hard to see the river.\'94 The pale moonlight glinted against the black chainmail Raithen wore over a dark green shirt. The ship\'92s captain was always sartorially perfect, even this early in the morning. Or this late at night, Cholik amended, for he didn\'92t know which was the case for the pirate chieftain. Raithen\'92s black breeches were tucked with neat precision into his rolled-top boots. \'93And I still think maybe we didn\'92t get away so clean from the last bit of business we did.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The fog also makes navigating the river risky,\'94 Cholik said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Maybe to you, but for a man used to the wiles and ways of the sea,\'94 Raithen said, \'93that river down there would offer smooth sailing.\'94 He pulled at his beard as he looked down at the sea again, then nodded. \'93If it was me, I\'92d make a run at us tonight.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You\'92re a superstitious man,\'94 Cholik said, and couldn\'92t help putting some disdain in his words. He wrapped his arms around himself. Unlike Raithen, Cholik was thin to the point of emaciation. The night\'92s unexpected chill predicting the onset of the coming winter months had caught him off-guard and ill prepared. He no longer had the captain\'92s young years to tide him over, either. The wind, now that he noticed it, cut through his black and scarlet robes.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen glanced back at Cholik, his expression souring as if he were prepared to take offense at the assessment.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A scowl twisted Raithen\'92s face. His own dislike and distrust concerning what Cholik\'92s acolytes did in the lower regions of the town they\'92d found buried beneath the abandoned port city were well known. The site was far to the north of Westmarch, well out of the king\'92s easy reach. As desolate as the place was, Cholik would have thought the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint8}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint8}pirate captain would be pleased about the location. But the priest had forgotten the civilized amenities the pirates had available to them at the various ports that didn\'92t know who they were\'97or didn\'92t care because their gold and silver spent just as quickly as anyone else\'92s. Still, the drinking and debauchery the pirates were accustomed to were impossible where they now camped.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Despite his grim mood, a small smile twisted Raithen\'92s lips. \'93For a priest of Zakarum Church, which professes a way of gentleness, you\'92ve got an unkind way about your words.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Folding his arms across his massive chest, Raithen leaned back against the balcony and chuckled. \'93You do intrigue me, Cholik. When we became acquainted all those months ago and you told me what you wanted to do, I thought you were a madman.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93A legend of a city buried beneath another city isn\'92t madness,\'94 Cholik said. However, the things he\'92d had to do to secure the sacred and almost forgotten texts of Dumal Lunnash, a Vizjerei wizard who had witnessed the death of Jere Harash thousands of years ago, had almost driven him there.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Thousands of years ago, Jere Harash had been a young Vizjerei acolyte who had discovered the power to command the spirits of the dead. The young boy had claimed{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint9}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint9}the insight was given to him through a dream. There was no doubting the new abilities Jere Harash mustered, and his power became a thing of legend. The boy perfected the process whereby the wizards drained the energy of the dead, making anyone who used it more powerful than anything that had gone on before. As a result of this new knowledge, the Vizjerei\'97one of the three primary clans in the world thousands of years ago\'97had become known as the Spirit Clans.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Dumal Lunnash had been a historian and one of the men to have survived Jere Harash\'92s last attempt to master the spirit world completely. Upon the young man\'92s attaining the trance state necessary to transfer the energy to the spells he wove, a spirit had taken control of his body and gone on a killing rampage. Later, the Vizjerei had learned that the spirits they called on and unwittingly unleashed into the world were demons from the Burning Hells.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  As a chronicler of the times and the auguries of the Vizjerei, Dumal Lunnash had largely been overlooked, but his texts had led Cholik through a macabre and twisted trail that had ended in the desolation of the forgotten city on the Dyre River.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Raithen said. \'93Legends like that are everywhere. I\'92ve even followed a few of them myself, but I\'92ve never seen one come true.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Then I\'92m surprised that you came at all,\'94 Cholik said. This was a conversation they\'92d been avoiding for months, and he was surprised to find it coming out now. But only in a way. From the signs they\'92d been finding the last week, while Raithen had been away plundering and pillaging, or whatever it was that Raithen\'92s pirates did while they were away, Cholik had known they were close to discovering the dead city\'92s most important secret.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It was your gold,\'94 Raithen admitted. \'93That was what turned the trick for me. Now, since I\'92ve returned again, I\'92ve seen the progress your people are making.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A bitter sweetness filled Cholik. Although he was glad to be vindicated in the pirate captain\'92s eyes, the priest also{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint10}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint10}knew that Raithen had already started thinking about the possibility of treasure. Perhaps in his uninformed zeal, he or his men might even damage what Cholik and his acolytes were there to get.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93When do you think you\'92ll find what you\'92re looking for?\'94 Raithen asked.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The big pirate shrugged. \'93It might help me to have some idea. If we were followed today . . .\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93If you were followed today,\'94 Cholik snapped, \'93then it would be all your fault.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen gave Cholik a wolfish grin. \'93Would it, then?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You are wanted by the Westmarch Navy,\'94 Cholik said, \'93for crimes against the king. You\'92ll be hanged if they find you, swung from the gallows in Diamond Quarter.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Like a common thief?\'94 Raithen arched an eyebrow. \'93Aye, maybe I\'92ll be swinging at the end of a gallows like a loose sail at the end of a yardarm, but don\'92t you think the king would have a special punishment meted out to a priest of the Zakarum Church who had betrayed his confidence and had been telling the pirates what ships carry the king\'92s gold through the Gulf of Westmarch and through the Great Ocean?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen\'92s remarks stung Cholik. The Archangel Yaerius had coaxed a young ascetic named Akarat into founding a religion devoted to the Light. And for a time, Zakarum Church had been exactly that, but it had changed over the years and through the wars. Few mortals, only those within the inner circles of the Zakarum Church, knew that the church had been subverted by demons and now followed a dark, mostly hidden evil through their inquisitions. The Zakarum Church was also tied into Westmarch and Tristram, the power behind the power of the kings. By revealing the treasure ships\'92 passage, Cholik had also enabled the pirates to steal from the Zakarum Church. The priests of the church were even more vengeful than the king.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Turning from the bigger man, Cholik paced on the balcony in an effort to warm himself against the night\'92s chill.\plain \f2\i\fs24 I{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint11}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint11}knew it would come to this at some point,\plain \f2\fs24 he told himself.\plain \f2\i\fs24 This was to be expected.\plain \f2\fs24 He let out a long, deliberate breath, letting Raithen think for a time that he\'92d gotten the better of him. Over his years as a priest, Cholik had found that men often made even more egregious mistakes when they\'92d been praised for their intelligence or their power.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik knew what real power was. It was the reason he\'92d come there to Tauruk\'92s Port to find long-buried Ransim, which had died during the Sin War that had lasted centuries as Chaos had quietly but violently warred with the Light. That war had been long ago and played out in the east, before Westmarch had become civilized or powerful. Many cities and towns had been buried during those times. Most of them, though, had been shorn of their valuables. But Ransim had been hidden from the bulk of the Sin War. Even though the general populace knew nothing of the Sin War except that battles were fought\'97though not because the demons and the Light warred\'97they\'92d known nothing of Ransim. The port city had been an enigma, something that shouldn\'92t have existed. But some of the eastern mages had chosen that place to work and hide in, and they\'92d left secrets behind. Dumal Lunnash\'92s texts had been the only source Cholik had found regarding Ransim\'92s whereabouts, and even that book had led only to an arduous task of gathering information about the location that was hidden in carefully constructed lies and half-truths.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What do you want to know, captain?\'94 Cholik asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What you\'92re seeking here,\'94 Raithen replied with no hesitation.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93If it\'92s gold and jewels, you mean?\'94 Cholik asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93When I think of treasure,\'94 Raithen said, \'93those are the things that I spend most of my time thinking about and wishing for.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Amazed at how small-minded the man was, Cholik shook his head. Wealth was only a small thing to hope for, but power\'97power was the true reward the priest lusted for.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What?\'94 Raithen argued. \'93You\'92re too good to hope for{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint12}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint12}gold and jewels? For a man who betrays his king\'92s coffers, you have some strange ideas.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Material power is a very transitory thing,\'94 Cholik said. \'93It is of finite measure. Often gone before you know it.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik gazed up at the star-filled heavens. \'93Mankind is a futile embarrassment to the heavens, Captain Raithen. An imperfect vessel imperfectly made. We play at being omnipotent, knowing the potential perhaps lies within us yet will always be denied to us.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We\'92re not talking about gold and jewels that you\'92re looking for, are we?\'94 Raithen almost sounded betrayed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93There may be some of that,\'94 Cholik said. \'93But that is not what drew me here.\'94 He turned and gazed back at the pirate captain. \'93I followed the scent of power here, Captain Raithen. And I betrayed the King of Westmarch and the Zakarum Church to do it so that I could secure your ship for my own uses.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Power?\'94 Raithen shook his head in disbelief. \'93Give me a few feet of razor-sharp steel, and I\'92ll show you power.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Angry, Cholik gestured at the pirate captain. The priest saw waves of slight, shimmering force leap from his extended hand and streak for Raithen. The waves wrapped around the big man\'92s throat like steel bands and shut his breath off. In the next instant, Cholik caused the big man to be pulled from his feet. No priest could wield such a power, and it was time to let the pirate captain know he was no priest. Not anymore. Not ever again.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Now that the oars no longer rowed, the longboat didn\'92t cut through the river water. Instead, the boat seemed to come up from the water and settle with harsh awkwardness on the current.

After all these months of successful raids against the king\'92s merchanters, still no one knew how they got their information about the gold shipments. However, they had left only the Lut Gholein man alive, suggesting that they hadn\'92t wanted anyone from Westmarch to escape who might identify them.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The anchor scraped across the stone riverbed, taking away the margin for success by steady inches. The water and the sound of the current muted the noise. Then the anchor stopped and the rope jerked taut in Tomas\'92s hands. Catching the rope in his callused palms, the sailor squeezed tight.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The longboat stopped but continued to bob on the river current.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But still, the crew had faced a ship of dead men only months ago while on patrol. The fighting then had been brutal and frightening, and it had cost lives of shipmates before the undead sailors and their ship had been sent to the bottom of the sea.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Grabbing his cutlass from among the weapons wrapped in the bottom of the longboat, Darrick stood with care, making sure he balanced the craft out. He took a final glance up at the tops of the cliffs. The last sentry point they\'92d identified lay a hundred yards back. The campfire still burned through the layers of fog overhead.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Without another word, Darrick slipped over the side of the boat and into the river. The cold water closed over him at once, taking his breath away, and he swam against the current toward the riverbank.

Surprise and fear marked Raithen\'92s face, and Cholik knew the man realized he wasn\'92t facing the weak old priest he thought he\'92d been talking to with such disregard. The big pirate opened his mouth and struggled to speak. No words came out. At a gesture, Cholik caused Raithen to float out over the balcony\'92s edge and the hundred-foot drop that lay beyond.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He turned his gaze from the stars to the fogbound river. The white, cottony masses roiled across the broken land forming the coastal area. Farther north, barbarian tribes would have been a problem to their discovery, but here in{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint20}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint20}the deadlands far north of Westmarch and Tristram, they were safe.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  At least, Cholik mused, they were safe if Raithen\'92s latest excursion to take a shipload of the king\'92s gold fresh out of Westmarch had not brought someone back. He peered down at the layers of fog, but he could see only the tall masts of the pirate ships standing out against the highest wisps of silver-gray fog.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lanterns aboard those ships created pale yellow and orange nimbi and looked like fireflies in the distance. Men\'92s raucous voices, the voices of pirates and not the trained acolytes Cholik had handpicked over the years, called out to one another in casual disdain. They talked of women and spending the gold they\'92d fought for that day, unaware of the power that lay buried under the city.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Only Raithen was becoming more curious about what they sought. The other pirates were satisfied with the gold they continued to get.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik cursed his palsied hands and the cold wind that swept over the Hawk\'92s Beak Mountains to the east. If only he were young, if only he\'92d found the sacred Vizjerei text sooner . . .

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Startled from his musings but recovering in short order, Cholik turned. He tucked his shaking hands out of sight inside his robes. \'93What is it, Nullat?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Forgive me for interrupting your solitude, Master Cholik.\'94 Nullat bowed. He was in his early twenties, dark-haired and dark-eyed. Dirt and dust stained his robes, and scratches adorned his smooth face and one arm from an accident during the excavation only a few days ago that had claimed the lives of two other acolytes.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik nodded. \'93You know better than to interrupt unless it was something important.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes. Brother Altharin asked me to come get you.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Inside his withered chest, Cholik\'92s heart beat faster. Still, he maintained the control he had over himself and his emotions. All of the acolytes he\'92d bent to his own ends{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint21}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint21}feared him, and feared his power, but they remained hungry for the gifts they believed he would bestow. He intended to keep it that way. He kept silent, refusing to ask the question that Nullat had left hanging in the air.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Altharin believes we have reached the final gate,\'94 Nullat said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And has Altharin halted his work?\'94 Cholik asked.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Of course, master. Everything has gone as you have ordered. The seals were not broken.\'94 Nullat\'92s face creased with worry.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Is something wrong?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hesitation held Nullat mute for a moment. The pirates\'92 voices and the clangor of ships\'92 lines and rigging against yardarms and masts continued unabated from below.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Altharin thinks he has heard voices on the other side of the gate,\'94 Nullat said. His eyes broke from Cholik\'92s.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Voices?\'94 Cholik repeated, feeling more excited. The sudden rush of adrenaline caused his hands to shake more. \'93What kind of voices?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Evil voices.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik stared at the young acolyte. \'93Did you expect any other kind?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The Black Road is not a way found by those faint of heart.\'94 In fact, Cholik had inferred from the sacred Vizjerei texts that the tiles themselves had been shaped from the bones of men and women who had been raised in a village free of evil and strife. They\'92d never known need or want until the population had grown large enough to serve the demons\'92 needs. \'93What do these voices say?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Nullat shook his head. \'93I cannot say, master. I do not understand them.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And what does the final gate look like?\'94 Cholik asked.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93As you told us it would, master. Immense and fearful.\'94 Nullat\'92s eyes widened. \'93I\'92ve never seen anything like it.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Pressed into the side of the mist-covered cliff, holding himself on his boot toes and the fingers of one hand, Darrick Lang reached for the next handhold. He was conscious of the rope tied around his waist and loins. He\'92d tacked the rope to a ship\'92s spike he\'92d driven into the cliffside five feet below, leaving a trail of them behind him for the others to use. If he slipped and everything worked right, the rope would keep him from plunging to his death or into the river sixty feet below. If it worked wrong, he might yank the two men anchoring him to the side of the cliff down after him. The fog was so thick below that he could no longer see the longboat.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  I should have brought Caron along,\plain \f2\fs24 Darrick thought as he curled his fingers around the rocky outcrop that looked safe enough to hold his weight. Caron was only a boy, though, and not one to bring into a hostile situation. Aboard\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star,\plain \f2\fs24 Caron was ruling king of the rigging. Even when he wasn\'92t assigned aloft, the boy was often found there. Caron had a natural penchant for high places.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Resting for just a moment, feeling the trembling muscles in his back and neck, Darrick breathed out and inhaled the wet, musty smell of rock and hard-packed earth. It smelled, he couldn\'92t help thinking, like a newly opened grave. His clothing was wet from the immersion in the river, and he was cold, but his body still found enough heat to break out in perspiration. It surprised him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You aren\'92t planning on camping out up there, are you?\'94 Mat called up. He sounded good-natured about it, but someone who knew him well could have detected the small tension in his voice.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It\'92s the view, you know,\'94 Darrick called down. And it amused him that they acted as if they were there for a lark{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint23}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint23}instead of serious business. But it had always been that way between them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  They were twenty-three years old, Darrick being seven months the elder, and they\'92d spent most of those years as friends growing up in Hillsfar. They\'92d lived among the hill people, loaded freight in the river port, and learned to kill when barbarian tribes had come down from the north hoping to loot and pillage. When they\'92d turned fifteen, they\'92d journeyed to Westmarch and pledged loyalty in the king\'92s navy. Darrick had gone to escape his father, but Mat had left behind a good family and prospects at the family mill. If Darrick had not left, Mat might not ever have left, and some days Darrick felt guilty about that. Dispatches from home always made Mat talk of the family he missed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Focusing himself again, Darrick stared out across the broken land at the harbor less than two hundred yards away. Another pirate sentry was encamped on the cliff along the way. The man had built a small, yellow-tongued fire that couldn\'92t be seen from the river.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Beyond, three tall-masted cogs, round-bodied ships built for river travel as well as coastal waters rather than the deep sea, lay at anchor in a dish-shaped natural harbor fronting the ruins of a city. Captain Tollifer\'92s maps had listed the city as Tauruk\'92s Port, but not much was known about it except that it had been deserted years ago.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lanterns and torches moved along the ships, but a few also roved through the city, carried by pirates, Darrick felt certain. Though why they should be so industrious this early in the morning was beyond him. The swirling fog laced with condensation made seeing across the distance hard, but Darrick could make out that much.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The longboat held fifteen men, including Darrick. He figured that they were outnumbered at least eight to one by the pirates. Staying for a prolonged engagement was out of the question, but perhaps spiriting the king\'92s nephew away and costing the pirates a few ships were possible. Darrick had volunteered for such work before, and he\'92d come through it alive.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint24}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint24}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  So far, bucko,\plain \f2\fs24 Darrick told himself with grim realization.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Although he was afraid, part of him was excited at the challenge. He clung to the wall, lifted a boot, and shoved himself upward again. The top of the cliff ledge was less than ten feet away. From there, it looked as if he could gain safe ground and walk toward the city ruins and the hidden port. His fingers and toes ached from the climb, but he put the discomfort out of his mind and kept moving.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  When he reached the clifftop, he had to restrain a cry of triumph. He turned and looked back down at Mat, curling his hand into a fist.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Even at the distance, Darrick saw the look of horror that filled Mat\'92s face. \'93Look out!\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Whipping his head back up, some inner sense warning him of the movement, Darrick caught a glimpse of moonlight-silvered steel sweeping toward him. He pulled his head down and released his hold on the cliff as he grabbed for another along the cliff\'92s edge.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sword chopped into the stone cliff, striking sparks from the high iron ore content just as Darrick\'92s hands closed around the small ledge he\'92d pushed up from last. His body slammed hard against the mountainside.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I told you I saw somebody out here,\'94 a man said as he drew his sword back again and stepped with care along the cliff\'92s edge. His hobnailed boots scraped stone.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yeah,\'94 the second man agreed, joining the first in the pursuit of Darrick.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Scrambling, holding tight to the edge of the cliff, Darrick pressed his boots against the stone and tried in vain to find suitable purchase to allow him to push himself up. He gave thanks to the Light that the pirates were almost as challenged by the terrain as he was. His boot soles scraped and slid as he tried to pull himself up.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Cut his fingers off, Lon,\'94 the man in back urged. He was a short, weasel-faced man with an ale belly pressing against his frayed shirt. Maniacal lights gleamed in his eyes. \'93Cut his fingers off, and watch him fall on the others down there. Before they can make it up, we can nip on{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint25}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint25}down to the bonfire and warn Captain Raithen they\'92s coming.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick filed the name away. During his years as part of the Westmarch Navy, he\'92d heard of Raithen. In fact, Captain Tollifer had said that the Captain\'92s Table, the quarterly meeting of chosen ships\'92 captains in Westmarch, had suggested Raithen as a possible candidate for the guilty party in the matter of the pirate raids. It was good to know, but staying alive to relate the news might prove difficult.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Stand back, Orphik,\'94 Lon growled. \'93You keep abuzzing around me like a bee, and I\'92m gonna stick you myself.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Shove off, Lon. I\'92ll do for him.\'94 The little man\'92s voice tittered with naked excitement.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Damn you,\'94 Lon cursed. \'93Get out of the way.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Quick as a fox in a henhouse, Orphik ducked under his companion\'92s outstretched free arm and dashed at Darrick with long-bladed knives that were almost short swords in their own right. He laughed. \'93I\'92ve got him, Lon. I\'92ve got him. Just sit you back and watch. I bet he screams the whole way down.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Keeping his weight distributed as evenly as possible, going with the renewed strength that flowed through his body from the adrenaline surge, Darrick swung from hand to hand, dodging the chopping blows Orphik delivered. Still, one of the pirate\'92s attempts slashed across the knuckle of his left hand\'92s little finger. Pain shot up Darrick\'92s arm, but he was more afraid of how the blood flow would turn his grip slippery.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Damn you!\'94 Orphik swore, striking sparks from the stone again. \'93Just stay still, and this will be over with in a trice.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lon reeled back away from the smaller man. \'93Look out, Orphik! Someone down there has a bow!\'94 The bigger pirate held up a sleeve and displayed the arrow that had caught on its fletchings and still hung there.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Distracted by the presence of the arrow and aware that another could be joining it at any moment, Orphik stepped{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint26}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint26}back a little. He drew up a boot and lashed out at his intended victim\'92s head.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick swung to one side and grabbed for the little man\'92s leg with his bloody hand, not wanting to trade it for the certain grip of his right. He knotted his fingers in the pirate\'92s breeches. Even though the breeches were tucked into the hobnailed boots, there was plenty of slack to seize. Balancing his weight from one hand on the cliff, Darrick yanked hard with the other.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Damn him! Lon, give me your hand before this bilge rat yanks me off the cliff!\'94 Orphik reached for the other man, who caught his hand in his own. Another arrow fired from below clattered against the cliff wall behind them and caused them both to duck.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taking advantage of the confusion, knowing he\'92d never get a better chance, Darrick swung his weight to the side and up. He pushed his feet ahead of him, throwing his body behind, hoping to clear the cliff\'92s edge or he would fall. Maybe the rope tied around his loins would hold him, or maybe Mat and the other men below had forgotten it in the mad rush of events.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Arching his body and rolling toward the ledge, Darrick hit hard. He started to fall, then threw an arm forward in desperation, praying it would be enough. For a gut-wrenching moment, he teetered on the edge, then the point of balance shifted, and he sprawled facedown on the ledge.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Buyard Cholik followed Nullat down through the twisting bowels of Tauruk\'92s Port into the pockets of pestilence that remained of Ransim. Enclosed in the rock and strata that were the younger city\'92s foundation, the harbor seemed a million miles away, but the chill that had followed the fog into the valley remained with the old priest. Aches and pains he\'92d managed to keep warm in his rooms now returned with a vengeance as he made his way through the tunnels.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 The acolyte carried an oil torch, and the ceiling was so low that the writhing flames left immediate traces of lampblack along the granite surfaces. Filled with nervous anxiety, Nullat glanced from left to right, his head moving like a fast metronome.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik ignored the acolyte\'92s apprehensions. In the beginning, when the digging had begun in earnest all those months ago, Tauruk\'92s Port had been plagued with rats. Captain Raithen had suggested that the rats had infested the place while trailing after the camp lines of the barbarians who came down out of the frozen north. During hard winters, and last year\'92s was just such a one, the barbarians found warmer climes farther south.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But there was something else the rats had fed on as well after they\'92d reached Tauruk\'92s Port. It wasn\'92t until after the excavation had begun that Cholik realized the horrible truth of it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  During the Sin War, when Vheran constructed the mighty gate and let Kabraxis back into the worlds of men, spells had been cast over Tauruk\'92s Port to protect it and hide it from the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint28}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint28}war to the east. Or maybe the city had been called Ransim at that time. Cholik hadn\'92t yet found a solid indication of which city had been ensorcelled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The spells that had been cast over the city had raised the dead, giving them a semblance of life to carry out the orders of the demons who had raised them. Necromancy was not unknown to most practitioners of the Arts, but few did more than dabble in them. Most people believed necromancy often linked the users to the demons such as Diablo, Baal, and Mephisto, collectively called the Prime Evils. However, necromancers from the cult of Rathma in the eastern jungles fought for the balance between the Light and the Burning Hells. They were warriors pure of heart even though most feared and hated them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The first party of excavators to punch down through the bottom layer of Tauruk\'92s Port had discovered the undead creatures that yet lurked in the ruins of the city below. Cholik guessed that whatever demon had razed Ransim had been sloppy with its spellwork or had been in a hurry. Ransim had been invaded, the burned husks of buildings and carnage left behind offered mute testimony to that, and all among them had been slain. Then someone with considerable power had come into the city and raised the dead.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Zombies rose from where fresh corpses lay, and even skeletons in the graveyards had clawed their way free of their earthen tombs. But not all of them had made the recovery to unlife in time to go with whatever master had summoned them. Perhaps, Cholik had thought on occasion, it had taken years or decades for the rest of the populace to rise.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But those dead had risen, their flesh frozen somehow in a nether point short of death. Their limbs had atrophied, but their flesh had only withered without returning to the earth. And when the rats had come, they\'92d funneled down through the cracks and the crevices of Tauruk\'92s Port to get to the city below. Since that day, the rats had feasted, and their population had reached prodigious numbers.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint29}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint29}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Of course, when presented with prey that could still fight even though a limb was gnawed off or a human with fresh blood that would lie down and die if dealt enough injury, the rats had chosen to stalk the excavation parties. For a time, the attrition rate among the diggers had been staggering. The rats had proven a resilient and resourceful enemy over the long months.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Captain Raithen had been kept busy raiding Westmarch ships, then buying slaves with Cholik\'92s share of the gold. More gold had gone to the mercenaries whom the priest employed to keep the slaves in line.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Step carefully, master,\'94 Nullat said, raising the torch so the light showed the yawning black pit ahead. \'93There\'92s an abyss here.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93There was an abyss there the last time I came this way,\'94 Cholik snapped.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Of course, master. I just thought perhaps you\'92d forgotten because it has been so long since you were down here.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik made his voice cold and hard. \'93I don\'92t forget.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Nullat\'92s face blanched, and he cut his eyes away from the priest\'92s. \'93Of course you don\'92t, master. I only\'97\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Quiet, Nullat. Your voice echoes in these chambers, and it wearies me.\'94 Cholik walked on, watching as Nullat flinched from a sudden advance of a red-eyed rat pack streaming along the pile of broken boulders to their left.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  As long as a man\'92s arm from elbow to fingertips, the rats raced over the boulders and one another as they fought to get a closer view of the two travelers. They chattered and squeaked, creating an undercurrent of noise that pealed throughout the chamber. Sleek black fur covered them from their wet noses to their plump rumps, but their tails remained hairless. Piles of old bones, and perhaps some new ones as well, adorned the heaps of broken stone, crumbled mortise work, and splintered debris left from dwellings.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Nullat stopped and, trembling, held the torch out toward the rat pack. \'93Master, perhaps we should turn back. I\'92ve not seen such a gathering of rats in weeks. There are enough of them to bring us down.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint30}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint30}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Be calm,\'94 Cholik ordered. \'93Let me have your torch.\'94 The last thing he wanted was for Nullat\'92s ravings to begin talk of an omen again. There had been far too much of that.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hesitating a moment as if worried Cholik might take the torch from him and leave him in the darkness with the rats, Nullat extended the torch.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik gripped the torch, steadying it with his hand. He whispered words of prayer, then breathed on the torch. His breath blew through the torch and became a wave of flame that blasted across the piles of stones and debris like a blacksmith\'92s furnace as he turned his head from one side to the other across the line of rats.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Crying out, Nullat dropped and covered his face, turning away from the heat and knocking the torch from Cholik\'92s grasp. The torch licked at the hem of Cholik\'92s robes.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Yanking his robes away, the priest said, \'93Damn you for a fool, Nullat. You\'92ve very nearly set me on fire.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93My apologies, master,\'94 Nullat whimpered, jerking the torch away. He moved it so fast that the speed almost smothered the flames. A pool of glistening oil burned on the stone floor where the torch had lain.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik would have berated the man further, but a sudden weakness slammed into him. He tottered on his feet, barely able to stand. He closed his eyes to shut out the vertigo that assailed him. The spell, so soon after the one he\'92d used against Raithen and so much stronger, had left him depleted.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Master,\'94 Nullat called out.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Shut up,\'94 Cholik ordered. The hoarseness of his voice surprised even him. His stomach rolled at the rancid smell of burning flesh that had filled the chamber.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Of course, master.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Forcing himself to take a breath, Cholik concentrated on his center. His hands shook and ached as if he\'92d broken every one of his fingers. The power that he was able to channel was becoming too much for his body.\plain \f2\i\fs24 How is it that the Light can make man, then permit him to wield powerful{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint31}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint31}auguries, only to strip him of the mortal flesh that binds him to this world?\plain \f2\fs24 It was that question that had begun turning him from the teachings of the Zakarum Church almost twenty years ago. Since that time, he had turned his pursuits to demons. They, at least, gave immortality of a sort with the power they offered. The struggle was to stay alive after receiving it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  When the weakness had abated to a degree, Cholik opened his eyes.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Nullat hunkered down beside him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  An attempt to make himself a smaller target if there are any vengeful rats left,\plain \f2\fs24 Cholik felt certain. The priest gazed around the chamber.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The magical fire had swept the underground chamber. Smoking and blackened bodies of rats littered the debris piles. Burned flesh had sloughed from bone and left a horrid stink. Only a few slight chitterings of survivors sounded, and none of them seemed inclined to come out of hiding.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Get up, Nullat,\'94 Cholik ordered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes, master. I was only there to catch you if you should fall.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I will not fall.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Glancing to the side of the trail as they went on, Cholik gazed down into the abyss to his left. Careful exploration had not proven there was a bottom to it, but it lay far below. The excavators used it as a pit for the bodies of dead slaves and other corpses and the debris they had to haul out of the recovered areas.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Despite the fact that he hadn\'92t been down in the warrens beneath Tauruk\'92s Port in weeks, Cholik had maintained knowledge of the twisting and turning tunnels that had been excavated. Every day, he scoured through all manner of things the crews brought to the surface. He took care in noting the more important and curious pieces in journals that he kept. Back in Westmarch, the information he\'92d recorded on the dig site alone would be worth thousands in gold. If money would have replaced the life and power he was losing{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint32}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint32}by degrees, he\'92d have taken it. But money didn\'92t do those things; only the acquisition of magic did that.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  And only demons gave so generously of that power.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The trail they followed kept descending, dipping down deep into the mountainside till Cholik believed they might even be beneath the level of the Dyre River. The constant chill of the underground area and the condensation on the stone walls further lent to that assumption.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Only a few moments later, after branching off into the newest group of tunnels that had been made through Ransim\'92s remains, Cholik spotted the intense glare created by the torches and campfires the excavation team had established. The team had divided into shifts, breaking into groups. Each group toiled sixteen hours, with an eight-hour overlap scheduled for clearing out the debris that had been dug out of the latest access tunnels. They slept eight hours a day because Cholik found that they couldn\'92t be worked any more than sixteen hours without some rest and sleep and still stay healthy for any appreciable length of time.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The mortality rate had been dimmed by such action and the protective wards Cholik had set up to keep the rats and undead at bay, but it had not been eradicated. Men died as they worked there, and Cholik\'92s only lament was that it took Captain Raithen so long to find replacements.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik passed through the main support chamber where the men slept. He followed Nullat\'92s lead into one of the new tunnels, skirting the piles of debris that fronted the entrance and the first third of the tunnel. The old priest passed the confusion with scant notice, his eyes drawn to the massive gray and green door that ended the tunnel.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Men worked on the edges of the massive door, standing on ladders to reach the top at least twenty feet tall. Hammers and chisels banged against the rock, and the sound echoed in the tunnel and the chamber beyond. Other men shoveled refuse into wheelbarrows and trundled them to the dumpsites at the front of the tunnel.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The torchlight flickered over the massive door, and it{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint33}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint33}inscribed the symbol raised there for all to see. The symbol consisted of six elliptical rings, one spaced inside another, with a twisting line threading through them in yet another pattern. Sometimes the twisting line went under the elliptical rings, and sometimes it went over.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Staring at the door, Cholik whispered, \'93Kabraxis, Banisher of the Light.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Get him! Get him! He\'92s up here with us!\'94 Orphik screamed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Glancing up, not wanting to leap into the path of the little man\'92s knives as he came at him on the cliff ledge, Darrick watched the pirate start for him. The hobnailed boots scratched sparks from the granite ledge.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Bloody bastard nearly did for me, Lon,\'94 Orphik crowed as he made his knives dance before him. \'93You stay back, and I\'92ll slit him between wind and water. Just you watch.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick had only enough time to push himself up on his hands. His left palm, coated in blood from his sliced finger, slipped a little and came close to going out from under him. But his fingers curled around a jutting rocky shelf, and he hurled himself to his feet.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Orphik swung his weapons in a double slash, right hand over left, scissoring the air only inches from Darrick\'92s eyes. He took another step back as the wiry little pirate tried to get him again with backhanded swings. Unwilling to go backward farther, knowing that a misstep along the narrow ledge would prove fatal, Darrick ducked below the next attack and stepped forward.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  As he passed the pirate, Darrick drew the long knife from his left boot, feeling it slide through his bloody fingers for just a moment. Then he curled his hand around the weapon as Orphik tried to spin to face him. Without mercy, knowing he\'92d already been offered no quarter, Darrick slashed at the man\'92s boot. The leather parted like butter at the knife\'92s keen kiss, and the blade cut through the pirate\'92s hamstring.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Losing control over his crippled foot, Orphik weaved{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint34}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint34}off-balance. He cursed and cried for help, struggling to keep the long knives before him in defense.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick lunged to his feet, slapping away Orphik\'92s wrists and planting a shoulder in the smaller man\'92s midsection. Caught by Darrick\'92s upward momentum and greater weight, Orphik left his feet, looking as if he\'92d jumped up from the ledge. The pirate also went out over the dizzying fall to the river below, squalling the whole way and flailing his arms. He missed Mat and the other sailors by scant inches, and only then because they\'92d all seen what had happened and had flattened themselves against the cliff wall.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Dropping to his knees and grabbing for the wall behind him, clutching the thick root from the tree on the next level of the cliffs that he spotted from the corner of his eye, Darrick only just prevented his own plunge over the cliff\'92s side. He gazed down, hypnotized by the suddenness of the event.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Orphik missed the river\'92s depths, though. The little pirate plunged headfirst into the shallows and struck the rocky bottom. The sickening crunch of his skull bursting echoed up the cliff.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Darrick!\'94 Mat called up.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Realizing the precariousness of his position, Darrick turned toward the other pirate, thinking the man might already be on top of him. Instead, Lon had headed away, back up the ledge that led to the passable areas on the mountains. He covered ground in long-legged strides that slammed and echoed against the stone.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93He\'92s makin\'92 for the signal fire,\'94 Mat warned. \'93If he gets to it, those pirates will be all over us. The life of the king\'92s nephew will be forfeit. Maybe our own as well.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cursing, Darrick shoved himself up. He started to run, then remembered the rope tied around his loins. Thrusting his knife between his teeth, he untied the knots with his nimble fingers. He spun and threw the rope around the tree root with a trained sailor\'92s skill and calm in the face of a sudden squall, gazing up the rocky ledge after the running pirate.\plain \f2\i\fs24 How far away is the signal fire?

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  When he had the rope secure, giving Lon only three more strides on his lead, Darrick yanked on the rope, testing it. Satisfied, he called down, \'93Rope\'92s belayed,\'94 then hurled himself after the fleeing pirate.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Get up and get dressed,\'94 Captain Raithen ordered without looking at the woman who lay beside him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Not saying a word, having learned from past mistakes that she wasn\'92t supposed to talk, the woman got up naked from the bed and crossed the room to the clothing she\'92d left on a chest.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Although he felt nothing for the woman, in fact even despised her for revealing to him again the weakness he had in controlling his own lusts, Raithen watched her as she dressed. He was covered in sweat, his and hers, because the room was kept too hot from the roaring blaze in the fireplace. Only a few habitable houses and buildings remained in Tauruk\'92s Port. This inn was one of those. The pirates had moved into it, storing food and gear and the merchandise they\'92d taken from the ships they\'92d sunk.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The woman was young, and even the hard living among the pirates hadn\'92t done much to destroy the slender lines and smooth muscles of her body. Half-healed cuts showed across the backs of her thighs, lingering evidence of the last time Raithen had disciplined her with a horsewhip.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Even now, as she dressed with methodical deliberation, she used her body to show him the control she still felt she had over him. He hungered for her even though he didn\'92t care about her, and she knew it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Her actions frustrated Raithen. Yet he hadn\'92t had her killed out of hand. Nor had he allowed the other pirates to have at her, keeping her instead for his own private needs. If she were dead, none of the other women they\'92d taken from ships they raided would satisfy him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Do you think you\'92re still so proud in spirit, woman?\'94 Raithen demanded.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You trying to rub my nose in something here, then?\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No.\'94 Her answer remained calm and quiet.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Her visible lack of emotion pushed at the boundaries of the tentative control Raithen had over his anger. His bruised neck still filled his head with blinding pain, and the humiliation he\'92d received at Cholik\'92s hands wouldn\'92t leave him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He thought again of the way the old priest had suspended him over the long drop from the rooms he kept in the city ruins, proving that he wasn\'92t the old, doddering fool Raithen had believed him to be. The pirate captain reached for the long-necked bottle of wine on the small stand by the bed. Gold and silver weren\'92t the only things he and his crew had taken from the ships they\'92d raided.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taking the cork from the bottle, Raithen took a long pull of the dark red wine inside. It burned the back of his throat and damn near made him choke, but he kept it down. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and glanced at the woman.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  She stood in a simple shift by the trunk, no shoes on her feet. After the beating he\'92d given her the first time, she wouldn\'92t dream of leaving without his permission. Nor would she ask for it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen put the cork back into the wine bottle. \'93I\'92ve never asked you your name, woman.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Her chin came up a little at that, and for a moment her eyes darted to his, then flicked away. \'93Do you want to know my name?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen grinned. \'93If I want you to have a name, I\'92ll give you one.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cheeks flaming in sudden anger and embarrassment, the woman almost lost control. She forced herself to swallow. The pulse at the hollow of her throat thundered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Grabbing the blanket that covered him, Raithen wiped his face and pushed himself from the bed. He\'92d hoped to drink enough to sleep, but that hadn\'92t happened.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Were you an important person in Westmarch, woman?\'94 Raithen pulled his breeches on. He\'92d left his sword and knife within easy reach out of habit, but the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint37}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint37}woman had never looked too long at either of them. She\'92d known they were a temptation she could ill afford.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92m not from Westmarch,\'94 the woman answered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen pulled on his blouse. He had other clothing back on his ship, and a hot bath as well because the cabin boy would know better than to let the water grow cold. \'93Where, then?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aranoch.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93He was a glassblower. He produced some of the finest glassware ever made.\'94 Her voice broke a little.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen gazed at her with cold dispassion, knowing he understood where the emotion came from. Once he\'92d found it, he couldn\'92t resist turning the knife. \'93Where is your father now?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Her lips trembled. \'93Your pirates killed him. Without mercy.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93He was probably resisting them. They don\'92t much care for that because I won\'92t let them.\'94 Raithen raked his disheveled hair with his fingers.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93My father was an old man,\'94 the woman declared. \'93He couldn\'92t have put up a fight against anyone. He was a kind and gentle soul, and he should not have been murdered.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Murdered?\'94 Raithen threw the word back at her. In two quick steps, he took away the distance that separated them. \'93We\'92re pirates, woman, not bloody murderers, and I\'92ll have you speak of that trade with a civil tongue.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  She wouldn\'92t look at him. Her eyes wept fearful tears, and they tracked down her bruised face.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Tracing the back of his hand against her cheek, Raithen leaned in and whispered in her ear. \'93You\'92ll speak of me, too, with a civil tongue, or I\'92ll have that tongue cut from your pretty head and let my seadogs have at you.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Her head snapped toward him. Her eyes flashed, reflecting the blaze in the fireplace.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen waited, wondering if she would speak. He taunted her further. \'93Did your father die well? I can\'92t remember. Did he fight back, or did he die screaming like an old woman?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Damn you!\'94 the woman said. She came around on him, swinging her balled fist at the end of her right arm.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Without moving more than his arm, Raithen caught the woman\'92s fist in one hand. She jerked backward, kicking at his crotch. Turning his leg and hip, the pirate captain caught the kick against his thigh. Then he moved his shoulders, backhanding her across the face.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Propelled by the force of the blow, the woman stumbled across the room and smacked against the wall. Dizzy, her eyes rolling back up into her head for a moment, she sank down splay-legged to her rump.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen sucked at the cut on the back of his hand that her teeth had caused. The pain made him feel more alive, and seeing her helpless before him made him feel more in control. His neck still throbbed, but the humiliation was shared now even though the woman didn\'92t know it.

And if I was an overconfident{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint39}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint39}braggart like a certain old priest, let\'92s say, I\'92d probably make the mistake of humbling you, then leaving you alive.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93But you and me, woman,\'94 Raithen went on, \'93we\'92re different. People judge us like we were nothing, that everything we say is just pomp and doggerel. They don\'92t understand that once we start hating them and plotting for them to fall, we\'92re only waiting for them to show a weakness we can exploit.\'94 He paused. \'93Just like you\'92ll suffer through every indignity I pass on your way to break you, and then remain strong enough to try to kill me.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  She stood and faced him, blood smearing her chin.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen smiled at her again, and this time the effort was warm and genuine. \'93I want to thank you for that, for squaring my beam and trimming my sails. Reminds me of the true course I have to follow in this endeavor.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Darrick drove his feet against the rocky ledge, aware of the dizzying sight of the fogbound river lying below. Here and there, moonlight kissed the surface, leaving bright diamonds in its wake. His breath whistled at the back of his throat, coming hard and fast. Knowing that Mat and the other sailors were already clambering up the rope cheered Darrick a little. Plunging through the darkness and maybe into a small party of pirates encamped along the cliff wasn\'92t a pleasant prospect.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 He carried his knife in his hand but left his cutlass in its scabbard at his side. The heavy blade thumped against his thigh. Covering his face with his empty hand and arm, he managed to keep the fir and spruce branches from his eyes. Other branches struck his face and left welts.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The big pirate followed a game trail through the short forest of conifers, but he left it in a rush, plunging through a wall of overgrown brush and disappearing.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick redoubled his efforts, almost overrunning his own abilities after the long, demanding climb up the mountainside. Black spots swam in his vision and he couldn\'92t get enough air in his lungs.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  If the pirates discovered them, Darrick knew he and his group of warriors had little chance of reaching\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star\plain \f2\fs24 out in the Gulf of Westmarch before the pirate ships overtook them. At the very least, they\'92d be killed out of hand, perhaps along with the young boy who had been taken captive.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick reached the spot where the pirate had lunged through the brush and threw himself after the man. Almost disoriented in the darkness of the forest, he lost his bearings{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint41}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint41}for a moment. He glanced up automatically, but the thick tree canopy blocked sight of the stars, so he couldn\'92t set himself straight. Relying on his hearing, tracking the bigger man\'92s passage through the brush, Darrick kept running.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Without warning, something exploded from the darkness. There was just enough ambient light for Darrick to get an impression of large leathery wings, glistening black eyes, and shiny white teeth that came at him. At least a dozen of the bats descended on him, outraged at the pirate\'92s passing. Their harsh squeals were near deafening in the enclosed space, and their sharp teeth lit fiery trails along his flesh for an instant.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick lashed out with his knife and never broke stride. The grimsable bats were noted for their pack-hunting abilities and often tracked down small game. Though he\'92d never seen it himself, Darrick had heard that flocks of the blood-drinking predators had even brought down full-grown men and stripped the flesh from their bones.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Only a short distance ahead, with the bats searching without success behind him, Darrick tripped over a fallen tree and went sprawling. He rolled with it, maintaining his hard-fisted grasp on the knife. The cutlass smashed against his hip with bruising force. Then he was up again, alert to the shift in direction his quarry had taken.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Breath burning the back of his throat, Darrick raced through the forest. His heart triphammered inside his chest, and his hearing was laced with the dulled roaring of blood in his ears. He caught a tree with his free hand and brought himself around in a sharp turn as the bark tore loose from the trunk.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The big pirate wasn\'92t faring well, either. His breathing was ragged and hoarse, and there was no measured cadence left to it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Given time, Darrick knew he could run the man to ground. But he was almost out of time. Even now he could see the flickering yellow light of a campfire glimmering in the darkness through the branches of the fir and spruce trees.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint42}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint42}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The pirate burst free of the forest and ran for the campfire.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Trap?\plain \f2\fs24 Darrick wondered.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Or desperation? Could be he\'92s more afraid of Captain Raithen\'92s rage than he is that I might overtake him.\plain \f2\fs24 Even the Westmarch captains showed harsh discipline. Darrick bore scars from whips in the past as he\'92d fought and shoved his way up through the ranks. The officers had never dished out anything more than he could bear, and one day some of those captains would regret the punishments they\'92d doled out to him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Without hesitating, knowing he had no choice about trying to stop the man, Darrick charged from the forest, summoning his last bit of energy. If there were more men than the one surviving pirate, he knew he was done for. He leaned into his running stride, coming close to going beyond his own control.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The campfire was set at the bottom of a low promontory. The twisting flames scrawled harsh shadows against the hollow of the promontory. Above it, only a short distance out of easy reach, the small cauldron of pitch blend that was the intended signal pot hung from a trio of crossed branches set into the ground.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick knew the signal pot was in clear view of the next post up the river. Once the pirate ignited the pitch blend, there was no way to stop the signal.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Wheezing and gasping for air, the pirate reached the campfire and bent down, grabbed a nearby torch, and shoved it into the flames. The torch caught at once, burning blue and yellow because the pitch had been soaked in whale oil. Holding the torch in one hand, the big pirate started up the promontory, making the climb with ease.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick threw himself at the pirate, hoping he had enough strength and speed left to make the distance. He caught the pirate knee-high with his shoulders, then slammed his face against the granite mountainside. Dazed, he felt the pirate fall back across him, and they both slid down the steep incline over the broken rock surface.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The pirate recovered first, shoving himself to his feet{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint43}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint43}and pulling his sword. Light from the campfire limned his face, revealing the fear and anger etched there. He took a two-handed hold on his weapon and struck.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick rolled away from the blade, almost disbelieving when the sword missed him. Still in motion, he rolled to a kneeling position, then drew his cutlass as he pushed himself to his feet. Knife in one hand and cutlass in the other, he set himself to face the pirate almost twice his size.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  New agony flared through Raithen as the woman ground her teeth in his neck. He felt his own warm blood spray down his neck, and panic welled from deep inside him, hammering at the confines of his skull like a captive tiger in a minstrel show. For one frightening moment he thought a vampire had attacked him. Maybe the woman had found a way to trade her essence to one of the undead monsters that Raithen suspected Buyard Cholik hunted through the ruins of the two cities.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mastering the cold fear that ran rampant along his spine, Raithen tried to back away.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Vampires aren\'92t real!\plain \f2\fs24 he told himself.\plain \f2\i\fs24 I\'92ve never seen one.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Sensing his movement, the woman butted into him, striking his chin with the top of her head, and threw her arms around him, holding tight as a leech. Her lips and teeth searched out new places, rending his flesh.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Screaming in pain, surprised at her maneuver even though he\'92d been expecting her to do something, Raithen shook and twisted his right arm. The small throwing knife concealed in a cunning sheath there dropped into his waiting palm butt-first. He wrapped his fingers around the knife haft, turned his hand, and drove it into the woman\'92s stomach.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Her mouth opened in a strained gasp that feathered over his cheek. She released his neck and wrapped her hands around his forearm, pushing to pull the knife from her body. She shook her head in denial and stumbled back.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Grabbing the back of her head, knotting his fingers in her hair so she couldn\'92t just slip away from him and{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint44}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint44}maybe even make it through the doorway out of the room, Raithen stepped forward and trapped the woman against the wall. She looked up at him, eyes wide with wonder as he angled the knife up and searched for her heart.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Bastard,\'94 she breathed. A bloody rose bloomed on her lips as her blood-misted word emerged arthritically.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen held her, watching the life and understanding go out of her eyes, knowing full well what he was taking from her. His own fear returned to him in a rush as blood continued to stream down the side of his neck. He was afraid she\'92d been successful in biting through his jugular, which meant he would bleed to death in minutes, with no way to stop it. There were no healers on board the pirate ships in Tauruk\'92s Port, and all the priests were locked away for tonight or busy digging through the graves of Tauruk\'92s Port. Even then, there was no telling how many healers were among them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  In the next moment, the woman went limp, her dead weight pulling at the pirate captain\'92s arm.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Suspicious by nature, Raithen held on to the woman and his knife. She might have been faking\'97even with four inches of good steel in her. It was something he had done with success in the past, and taken two men\'92s lives in the process.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  After a moment of holding the woman, Raithen knew she would never move again. Her lips remained parted, colored a little by the blood that had stopped flowing. Dull and lifeless, her eyes stared through the pirate captain. Her face held no expression.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Damn me, woman,\'94 Raithen whispered with genuine regret. \'93Had I known you had this kind of fire in you before now, our times together could have been spent much better.\'94 He breathed in, inhaling the sweet fragrance of the perfume he\'92d given her from the latest spoils, then demanded that she wear to bed. He also smelled the coppery odor of blood. Both scents were intoxicating.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The door to the room broke open.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen prepared for the worst, spinning and placing{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint45}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint45}the corpse between himself and the doorway. He slipped the knife free of the dead woman\'92s flesh and held it before him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A grizzled man stepped into the room with a crossbow in his hands. He squinted against the bright light streaming from the fireplace. \'93Cap\'92n? Cap\'92n Raithen?\'94 The crossbow held steady in the man\'92s hands, aimed at the two bodies.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aim that damnfool thing away from me, Pettit,\'94 Raithen growled. \'93You can never trust a crossbow to hold steady.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sailor pulled the crossbow off line and canted the metal-encased butt against his hip. He reached up and doffed his tricorn hat. \'93Begging the cap\'92s pardon, but I thought ye was in some fair amount of rough water there. With all that squallering a-goin\'92 on, I mean.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Pettit grinned and spat into the dented bronze cuspidor in the corner of the room. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, then said, \'93Looks like ye\'92ve about had yer fill of that one. Want me to bring another one up?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No.\'94 Controlling the fear and curiosity that raged within him, Raithen cleaned his bloody knife on the woman\'92s clothes, then crossed the room to the mirror. It was cracked and contained dark gray age spots where the silver-powder backing had worn away. \'93But she did remind me of something, Pettit.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint46}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint46}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What\'92s that, cap\'92n?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93That damned priest, Cholik, has been thinking of us as lackeys.\'94 Raithen peered into the mirror, surveying the wound on his neck, poking at the edges of it with his fingers. Thank the Light, it wasn\'92t bleeding any more than it had been, and it even appeared to be stopping.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The flesh between the bite marks was raised, swollen, and already turning purple. Bits of skin and even the meat beneath hung in tatters. It would scar, Raithen knew. The thought made him bitter because he was vain about his looks. By most accounts, he was a handsome man and had taken care to remain that way. And it would give him a more colorful and acceptable excuse about how all the bruising had taken place around his neck.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye,\'94 Pettit grunted. \'93Them priests, they get up under a man\'92s skin with them high-and-mighty ways of theirs. Always actin\'92 like they got a snootful of air what\'92s better\'92n the likes of ye and me. There\'92s been a night or two on watch when I\'92d think about goin\'92 after one of them and guttin\'92 him, leavin\'92 him out for the others to find. Might put them in a more appreciatin\'92 frame o\'92 mind about what we\'92re a-doin\'92 here.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Satisfied that his life wasn\'92t in danger unless the woman was carrying some kind of disease that hadn\'92t become apparent yet, Raithen took a kerchief from his pocket and tied it around his neck. \'93That\'92s not a bad idea, Pettit.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Thank ye, cap\'92n. I\'92m always thinkin\'92. And, why, this here deserted city with all them stories o\'92 demons and the like, it\'92d be a perfect place to pull something like that. Why, we\'92d find out who the true believers were among ol\'92 Cholik\'92s bunch fer damn sure.\'94 He grinned, revealing only a few straggling, stained teeth remaining in his mouth.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Some of the men might get worried, too.\'94 Raithen surveyed the kerchief around his neck in the mirror. Actually, it didn\'92t look bad on him. In time, when the wound scarred over properly, he\'92d invent stories about how he\'92d gotten it in the arms of a lover he\'92d slain or stolen from, or some{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint47}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint47}crazed and passionate princess out of Kurast he\'92d taken for ransom then returned deflowered to her father, the king, after getting his weight in gold.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Well, we could tell the men what was what, cap\'92n.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93A secret, Pettit, is kept by one man. Even sharing it between the two of us endangers it. Telling a whole crew?\'94 Raithen shook his head and tried not to wince when his neck pained him. \'93That would be stupid.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Pettit frowned. \'93Well, somethin\'92 has to be done. Them priests has discovered a door down there in them warrens. An\'92 if the past behavior of them priests is anythin\'92 to go by, they ain\'92t a-gonna let us look at what\'92s behind it none.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93A door?\'94 Raithen turned to his second-in-command. \'93What door?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The big pirate, Lon, attacked Darrick Lang without any pretense at skilled swordplay. He just fetched up that huge sword of his in both hands and brought it crashing down toward Darrick\'92s head, intending to split it like an overripe melon.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Thrusting his cutlass up, knowing there was a chance that the bigger sword might shear his own blade but having no other choice for defense, Darrick caught the descending blade. He didn\'92t try to stop the sword\'92s descent, but he did redirect it to the side, stepping to one side as he did because he expected the sudden reversal the pirate tried. He didn\'92t entirely block the blow, though, and the flat of the blade slammed against his skull, almost knocking him out and leaving him disoriented.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Working on sheer instinct and guided by skilled responses, Darrick managed to lock his opponent\'92s blade with his while he struggled to hold on to his senses. His vision and hearing faded out, as the world sometimes did between slow rollers when\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star\plain \f2\fs24 followed wave troughs instead of cutting through them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Recovering a little, Lon shoved Darrick back but didn\'92t gain much ground.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Moving with skill and the dark savagery that filled him{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint48}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint48}any time he fought, Darrick took a step forward and head-butted the pirate in the face.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Moaning, Lon stumbled back.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick showed no mercy, pushing himself forward again. Obviously employing all the skill he had just to keep himself alive, the pirate kept retreating, stumbling and tripping over the broken terrain as he tried to walk up the incline behind him. Only a moment later, he went too far.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  As though from a great distance, Darrick heard the man\'92s boots scrape in the loose dirt, then the man fell, flailing and yelling, in the end wrapping his arms about his head. Ruthless and quick, Darrick knocked the pirate\'92s blade from his hand, sending the big sword spinning through the air to land in the dense brush a dozen yards away.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lon held his hands up. \'93I surrender! I surrender! Give me mercy!\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But, dazed as he was from the near miss of the sword, mercy was out of Darrick\'92s reach. He remembered the bodies he\'92d seen in the flotsam left by the plunderers who had taken the Westmarch ship. Even that was hard to hang on to, because his battered mind slipped even farther back into the past, recalling the beatings his father had given him while he was a child. The man had been a butcher, big and rough, with powerful, callused hands that could split skin over a cheekbone with a single slap.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  For a number of years, Darrick had never understood his father\'92s anger or rage at him; he\'92d always assumed he\'92d done something wrong, not been a good son. It wasn\'92t until he got older that he understood everything that was at play in their relationship.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Mercy,\'94 the pirate begged.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But the main voice that Darrick listened to was his father\'92s, cursing and swearing at him, threatening to beat him to death or bleed him out like a fresh-butchered hog. Darrick drew back his cutlass and swung, aiming to take the pirate\'92s head off.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint49}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint49}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Without warning, a sword darted out and deflected Darrick\'92s blow, causing the blade to cut into the earth only inches from the pirate\'92s arm-wrapped head. \'93No,\'94 someone said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Still lost in the memory of beatings he\'92d gotten at his father\'92s hands, the present overlapping the past, Darrick spun and lifted his sword. Incredibly, someone caught his arm before he could swing and halted the blow.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Darrick, it\'92s me. It\'92s me, Darrick. Mat.\'94 Thick and hoarse with emotion, Mat\'92s voice was little more than a whisper. \'93It\'92s me, damn it, leave off. We need this man alive.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Head filled with pain, vision still spotty from the pirate\'92s blow, Darrick squinted his eyes and tried to focus. Forced out as he made his way to the present reality, memory of those past events left with reluctance.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93He\'92s not your father, Darrick,\'94 Mat said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick focused on his friend, feeling the emotion drain from him, leaving him weak and shaking. \'93I know. I know that.\'94 But he knew he hadn\'92t, not really. The pirate\'92s blow had almost taken away his senses. He took in a deep breath and struggled to continue clearing his head.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We need him alive,\'94 Mat said. \'93There\'92s the matter of the king\'92s nephew. This man has information we can use.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I know.\'94 Darrick looked at Mat. \'93Let me go.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat\'92s eyes searched his, but the grip on his swordarm never wavered. \'93You\'92re sure?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Looking over his friend\'92s shoulder, Darrick saw the other sailors in his shore crew. Only old Maldrin didn\'92t seem surprised by the bloodthirsty behavior Darrick had exhibited. Not many of the crew knew of the dark fury that sometimes escaped Darrick\'92s control. It hadn\'92t gotten away from him for a long time until tonight.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92m sure,\'94 Darrick said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat released him. \'93Those times are past us. You don\'92t ever have to revisit them. Your father didn\'92t follow us from Hillsfar. We left him there those years ago. We left him there, and good riddance, I say.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint50}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint50}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Nodding, Darrick sheathed the cutlass and turned from them. He swept the horizon with his gaze, conscious of Mat\'92s eyes still on him. The fact that his friend didn\'92t trust him even after he\'92d said he was all right troubled and angered him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  And he seemed to hear his father\'92s mocking laughter ringing in his ears, pointing out his helplessness and lack of worth. Despite how far he\'92d pushed himself, even shoving himself up through the Westmarch Navy ranking, he\'92d never been able to leave that voice behind in Hillsfar.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick took a deep, shuddering breath. \'93All right, then, we\'92d best get at it, lads. Maldrin, take a couple men and fetch us up some water, if you please. I want this bonfire wetted so it can\'92t go up by design or by mistake.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye, sir,\'94 Maldrin responded, turning immediately and pointing out two men to accompany him. A quick search through the guards\'92 supplies netted them a couple of waterskins. After emptying the waterskins over the pitch blend torch, they set out for the cliff\'92s edge at once to get more water to finish the job.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Turning, Darrick surveyed the big pirate as Mat tied his hands behind his back with a kerchief. \'93How many of you were on guard here?\'94 Darrick asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The man remained silent.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ll not trouble myself to ask you again,\'94 Darrick warned. \'93At this point, and take care to fully understand what I\'92m telling you here, you\'92re a better bargain to me dead than you are alive. I don\'92t look forward to trying to complete the rest of my mission while bringing along a prisoner.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lon swallowed and tried to look defiant.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92d believe him if I were ye,\'94 Mat offered, patting the pirate on the cheek. \'93When he\'92s in a fettle like this, he\'92s more likely to have ye ordered thrown off the mountain than to keep ye alive an\'92 hope ye know some of the answers to whatever questions he might have.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lying on the ground as he was, Darrick knew it was hard for the pirate to feel in any way in control of the situation.{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint51}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint51}And Mat\'92s words made sense. The pirate just didn\'92t know Mat wouldn\'92t let Darrick act on an impulse like that. Anyway, the loss of control was behind him, and Darrick was in command of himself again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93So, go on, then,\'94 Mat encouraged in that good-natured way of his as he squatted down beside the captive. \'93Tell us what ye know.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The pirate regarded them both with suspicion. \'93You\'92ll let me live?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye,\'94 Mat agreed without hesitation. \'93I\'92ll give ye me word on it, I will, and spit on me palm to seal the deal.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93How do I know I can trust you?\'94 the pirate demanded.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat laughed a little. \'93Well, old son, we\'92ve done an\'92 let ye live so far, ain\'92t we?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick looked down at the man. \'93How many of you were there here?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Just us two,\'94 the pirate replied sullenly.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What time\'92s the changing of the guard?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hesitating, the pirate said, \'93Soon.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Pity,\'94 Mat commented. \'93If someone happens by in the next few minutes, why, I\'92ll have to slice your throat for ye, I will.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I thought you said you were going to let me live,\'94 the pirate protested.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat patted the man\'92s cheek again. \'93Only if we don\'92t have nasty surprises along the way.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The pirate licked his lips. \'93New guards won\'92t be until dawn. I just told you that so maybe you\'92d leave and Raithen wouldn\'92t be so vexed at me for not lighting the torch.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Well,\'94 Mat admitted, \'93it was a sound plan on your part. I\'92d probably have tried the same thing. But we\'92re here on some matter of consequence, ye see.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Sure,\'94 the pirate said, nodding. Mat\'92s behavior, as always in most circumstances, was so gentle and understanding that it was confounding.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Immediate relief went through Darrick.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What about the king\'92s nephew?\'94 Mat asked. \'93He\'92s just a boy, an\'92 I wouldn\'92t want to hear that anything untoward has happened to him.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Cap\'92n Raithen has him,\'94 the pirate said, wiping blood from his lip. \'93He\'92s keepin\'92 him aboard\plain \f2\i\fs24 Barracuda.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \'93That\'92s what brung me up here to see ye, cap\'92n,\'94 the first mate said. \'93Valdir sent this along just now as quick as he could after them priests found the door buried down in them ruins.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen crossed the room and took the paper. Unfolding it, he leaned toward the fireplace and the lantern that sat on the mantel.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Valdir was the current spy the pirate captain had assigned to Cholik\'92s excavation team. Raithen kept them rotated out with each new arrival of slaves. The men assigned didn\'92t care for it, and the fact that they didn\'92t become sickly and emaciated as the others did would draw attention from the mercenaries who remained loyal to Cholik\'92s gold.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The paper held a drawing of a series of elliptical lines, centered one within the other, and a different line running through them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What is this?\'94 Raithen asked.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Leaning, Pettit spat again, missing the cuspidor this time. He rubbed strings of spittle from his chin. \'93That there\'92s a symbol what Valdir saw on that door. It\'92s a huge door, cap\'92n, near to three times as tall as a man, the way Valdir puts it.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen knew that wasn\'92t the only reason Pettit had gone to see the men. Since the pirates had all the women in port, a fact that Cholik and his priests didn\'92t much care for, the mercenaries they\'92d hired had to negotiate prices for the women\'92s services with Pettit.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Being avaricious was one of the reasons Raithen had taken Pettit on as first mate. Pettit\'92s own knowledge that his loyalty ensured not only his career but also his life kept him in place. It helped that Raithen knew Pettit never saw himself as being a captain and that his only claim to power would be serving a captain who appreciated the cruel and conniving ways he had.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93When did the priests find the door?\'94 Raithen asked. If Cholik had known, why hadn\'92t the priest been there? Raithen still didn\'92t know why Cholik and his minions crawled through the detritus of the two cities like ants, but their obvious zeal for whatever they looked for had gotten him excited.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Buyard Cholik stared at the huge door that fronted the wall. In all the years of knowing about Kabraxis and of knowing the fate of Ransim buried beneath Tauruk\'92s Port, he\'92d never known how he would feel once he stood before the door that hid the demon\'92s secret. Even months of planning and work, of coming down to the subterranean depths on occasion to check on the work and inspire fear or reprisal in the acolytes who labored under his design, had left him unprepared.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Although he had expected to feel proud and exuberant about his discovery, Cholik had forgotten about the fear that now filled him. Quavers, like the tremor of an earthquake hidden deep within a land, ran through his body. He wanted to shriek and call on Archangel Yaerius, who first brought the tenets of Zakarum to men. But he did not. Cholik knew he had long passed the line of forgiveness that would be offered by any who followed the ways of Light.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  And what good would forgiveness do a dying old man? The priest taunted himself with that question as he had for the past few months and stiffened his resolve. Death was only another few years into the future for him, nothing worthwhile left during that distance.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Master,\'94 Brother Altharin whispered, \'93are you all right?\'94 He stood to Cholik\'92s right, two steps back as respect and the older priest\'92s tolerance dictated.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Letting his irritation burn away the traces that were left from his own anger and resentment at his approaching mortality, Cholik said, \'93Of course, I am all right. Why would I not be?\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik studied the massive door.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Or should I think of it as a gate?\plain \f2\fs24 The secret texts he\'92d read had suggested that Kabraxis\'92s door guarded another place as well as the hidden things the demon lord had left behind.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The slaves continued to labor, loading carts with broken rock with their bare hands by lantern light and torchlight. Their chains clinked and clanked against the hard stone ground. Other slaves worked with pickaxes, standing on the stone surrounding the door or atop frail scaffolding that quivered with every swing. The slaves spoke in fearful tones to one another, but they also hurried to finish uncovering the door. Cholik thought that was because they believed that they would be able to rest. If something behind the great door didn\'92t kill them, the old priest thought, perhaps for a time they would rest.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93So much of the door is uncovered,\'94 Cholik said. \'93Why was I not called earlier?\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Master,\'94 Altharin said, \'93there was no indication that we were so close to finding the door. We came upon another hard section of the dig, the wall that you see before you, which hid the door. I only thought that it was another section of cavern wall. So many times the path that you chose for us has caused us to punch through walls of the existing catacombs.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The city\'92s builders had constructed Ransim to take advantage of the natural caverns in the area above the Dyre River, Cholik remembered from the texts. The caves had provided warehouse area for the goods they trafficked in, natural cisterns of groundwater they could use in event of a siege\'97which had happened several times during the city\'92s history\'97and as protection from the elements because harsh storms often raced down from the summits of the Hawk\'92s Beak Mountains. Tauruk\'92s Port, founded after the destruction of Ransim, hadn\'92t benefited from access to the caverns.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93When we started to attack this wall,\'94 Altharin continued, \'93it fell out in large sections. That\'92s why so much rubble remains before the door.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik watched the slaves loading huge sections of broken stone into the carts, then pushing the carts up to the dump sites. Other slaves filled large buckets with smaller debris and filled more carts. The ironbound wheels creaked on dry axles and grated against the floor.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The work to uncover the door went quickly,\'94 Altharin said. \'93As soon as I knew we had found it, I sent for you.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik strode toward the door, drawing on the remaining dregs of his strength. His legs felt like lead, and his heart hammered against his ribs. He\'92d pushed himself too far. He knew that. The confrontation with Raithen and the spell he\'92d summoned to destroy the rats had shoved him past his limits. His breath felt tight in his chest. Using magic no longer came easy to the aged and infirm sometimes. Spellwork had its own demands and often left those too weak to handle the energies warped and broken. And he\'92d come into the spells late in life after wasting so many years in the Zakarum Church.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The ground inclined toward the door, and Cholik\'92s steps hastened of their own accord. Slaves noticed him coming and cleared the way, yelling at one another to get out of the way.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hammers rose and fell as more slaves put additional scaffolding into place, climbing higher up against the door. In their haste, part of the scaffolding fell, swinging like a pendulum from a fixed point, and four men fell with it. A lantern shattered against the stone floor and spilled a pool of oil that caught fire.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  One of the fallen men screamed in pain, clasping a shattered leg. The torchlight revealed the gleam of white bone protruding through his shin.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Get that fire put out,\'94 Altharin ordered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A slave threw a bucket of water over the fire but only succeeded in splashing it toward the huge door, spreading the flames into little pockets.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  One of the mercenaries stepped forward and cut the ragged shirt from a slave with quick flicks of his dagger. He dipped the shirt into another bucket of water, then{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint61}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint61}plopped the soaked garment on top of the fire. Sizzling, the fire died.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik strode forward through the fire, unwilling to show any fear of it. He summoned a small shield to protect him from the fire and walked through it unscathed. The act created the effect he wanted, drawing the slaves\'92 attention from their fear of the door and replacing it with their fear of him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The door was a threat, but a toothless one. Cholik had proven on several occasions that he had no compunctions about killing them and having their bodies thrown into the abyss. Gathering himself, standing now despite the weakness that filled him only because he refused to let himself falter, he turned to the slaves.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  All their frantic whispering stopped except for the groaning man nursing the broken leg. Even he hid his face in the crook of his arm, whimpering and no longer crying out.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Knowing he needed more strength to face whatever lay on the other side of Kabraxis\'92s door, Cholik spoke words of power, summoning the darkness to him that he had feared decades ago, only begun to dabble in a few years ago, and had grown strong in of late.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The old priest held up his right hand, fingers splayed. As he spoke the words, forbidden words to those of the Zakarum Church, he felt the power leech into him, biting through his flesh and sinking into his bones with razored talons. If the spell did not work, he was certain he would fall and risk becoming comatose until his body recovered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A purple nimbus flared around his hand. A bolt shot out and touched the slave with the broken leg. When the purple light spread over him and invisible hands grabbed him, the man screamed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik continued speaking, feeling stronger as the spell bound the man to him. His words came faster and more certain. The invisible hands spread-eagled the slave on the ground, then lifted him up, dangling him in the air.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No!\'94 the man screamed. \'93Please! I beg you! I will work! I will work!\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Once, the man\'92s fear and his pleading might have{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint62}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint62}touched Cholik. Those things did not touch Cholik intimately, for the old priest could never remember a time when he\'92d placed the needs of another above his own. But there had been times he\'92d gone with the Zakarum Church missionaries in the past to heal the sick and tend to wounded men. The recent trouble between Westmarch and Tristram had been rife with those incidents.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Nooooo!\'94 the man screamed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The other slaves drew back. Some of them called to the afflicted man.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik spoke again, then closed his fist. The purple nimbus turned dark, like the bruised flesh of a plum, and sped along the length of the beam that held the slave.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  When the darkness touched the slave, his body contorted. Horrible crunching echoed in the cavern as the man\'92s arms and legs shattered their sockets. He screamed anew, and despite the agony that must have been coursing through him, he remained alert and conscious.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A few of the priests who had left Westmarch with Cholik but who had not yet abdicated the ways of the Zakarum Church knelt and pressed their faces against the cavern floor. The teachings of the church held only tenets of healing and hope, of salvation. Only the Hand of Zakarum, the order of warriors consecrated by the church, and the Twelve Grand Inquisitors, who sought out and combated demonic activity within the populace of the church, used the blessings Yaerius and Akarat had given to those who had first chosen to follow.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Buyard Cholik was neither of those things. The priests who had put their faith in him had known that, had believed that he could make them more than what they were, but only now saw what they could become. Cholik, feeding off the slave\'92s fear and life as they came back to him through the conduit of the spell, was aware that some of his followers regarded him with fear while others looked at him hungrily.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Altharin was one of those horrified.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Bracing himself, not knowing for sure what to expect, Cholik spoke the final word of the spell.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint63}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint63}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The slave screamed in anguish, but the scream stopped in the middle. The spell ripped the man apart. The explosion of blood painted the frightened faces of the nearby men crimson and extinguished two torches as well as the residual pools of flame from the shattered lantern.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Amoment more, and the desiccated remains of the slave plopped against the cavern floor.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Even though he\'92d expected something, Cholik hadn\'92t expected the sudden rush of euphoria that filled him. Pain echoed within him as well, sweet misery as the vampiric spell worked the restorative effects. The lethargy that had descended upon him after using the spells earlier lifted. Even some of the arthritic pains that had started to blossom in his joints faded. Part of the stolen life energy went to him, to borrow and use as he saw fit, but the spell transferred some of it to the demon worlds as well. Spellcraft designed and given by the demons always benefited them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik stood straighter as the magical nimbus around him lightened from near black to purple again. Then the hellish light drew back inside him. Refreshed, senses thrumming, the old priest regarded his audience. What he\'92d done here tonight would trigger reaction in the slaves, the mercenaries, Raithen\'92s pirates, and even the priests. Some, Cholik knew, would not be there come morning.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  They would be afraid of him and of what he might do.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The realization made Cholik feel good, powerful. Even when he was a young priest of the Zakarum Church and holding a position in Westmarch, only the truly repentant and those without hope who wished to believe in something had clung to his words. But the men in the cavern watched him as canaries watched a hawk.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Turning from the dead slave, Cholik walked toward the door again. His feet moved with comfort and confidence. Even his own fears seemed pushed farther back in his mind.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Altharin,\'94 Cholik called.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes, master,\'94 Altharin responded in a quiet voice.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Have the slaves get back to work.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint64}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint64}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes, master.\'94 Altharin gave the orders.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Trained survivalists themselves, knowing they offered no blood allegiance, the mercenaries showed the greatest haste in getting the slaves back to work. Slaves secured the fallen scaffolding, and work began again. Pickaxes tore at the cavern wall covering the gray and green door. Sledges pounded huge sections of rock into pieces small enough for men to carry to the waiting carts. The steady thump and crack of the mining tools created a martial cadence that echoed within the cavern.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mastering his impatience, Cholik watched the progress of the slaves. As the slaves worked, whole sheets of rock fell, crashing against the floor or piles of debris that were already there. The mercenaries stayed among the slaves, lashing out with their whips and leaving marks and cuts against sweat-soaked skin. At times, the mercenaries even aided in shoving the laden carts into motion.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The work went faster. In moments, one of the door\'92s hinges came into view. Only a short time after that, further work revealed another hinge. Cholik studied them, growing more excited.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The hinges were large, gnarled works of metal and amber as Cholik had been expecting from the texts he\'92d read. The metal was there because man had made it, worked by smiths to hold back and constrain, but the amber was in place because it held the essence of the past trapped within the stirred golden depths.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  When enough debris was removed to make a path to the door, Cholik walked forward. The energy he\'92d taken from the slave wouldn\'92t last long, according to the materials he had read. Once depleted, he would be left in worse condition than he had been in unless he reached his rooms and the potions that he kept there to renew himself.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  As he neared the door, Cholik sensed the power that was contained within. The powerful presence surged in his brain, drawing him on and repelling him at the same time. Reaching into his robe, he removed the carved box made from a flawless black pearl.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint65}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint65}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He held the box in his hands, felt it cold as ice against his palms. Finding the box had required years of work. The secret texts concerning it and Kabraxis\'92s door had been hidden deep in the stacks kept in the Westmarch church. Keeping the box secret had required murder and treachery. Not even Altharin knew of it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Master,\'94 Altharin said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Back,\'94 Cholik demanded. \'93And take your rabble with you.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes, master.\'94 Altharin moved back, whispering to the men.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Gazing into the polished surface of the black pearl box, Cholik remained aware of the mass exodus from him and the gate. The old priest breathed deeply. During the years the box had been in his possession, while he\'92d researched and learned where Ransim had been hidden and developed the courage for such an undertaking and desperation strong enough to allow him to deal with the demon he\'92d have to confront to take what he wanted, he\'92d never been able to open the box. What the contents of the box were remained to be seen.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Breathing out, concentrating on the box and the door, Cholik spoke the first Word. His throat ached with the pain of it, for it was not meant for the human tongue. As the Word left his lips, deafening thunder cannonaded in the cavern, and a wind rose up, though no wind should have existed within the stone walls.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The elliptical design on the dark gray-green surface of the door turned deep black. A humming noise echoed through the cavern over the thunder and the gusting wind.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Closing his left hand over the black pearl box, Cholik strode forward, feeling the chill of the metal. He spoke the second Word, harder to master than the first.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The amber pieces in the huge hinges lit with unholy yellow light. They looked like the fires trapped in a wolf\'92s eyes reflecting torchlight at night.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The wind strengthened in intensity, picking up powdery-fine particles that stung flesh when they hit. Prayers echoed{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint66}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint66}within the cavern, all of them to the holy Light, not demons. It was almost enough to make Cholik smile, except that a small part of him was just as afraid as they were.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  At the third Word, the black pearl box opened. A gossamer sphere, glowing three different colors of green, lifted from the box. The sphere rolled in front of Cholik\'92s eyes. According to the materials he\'92d read, the sphere was death to touch.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  And if he faltered now, the sphere would consume him, leaving only smoking ash in its wake. Cholik spoke the fourth Word.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sphere started growing, swelling in size like the eels some fishermen took from the Great Ocean. Prized as an exotic delicacy, the flesh of the eels brought a narcotic bliss when prepared with proper care, but it brought death on occasion even when served by a master. Cholik had never eaten of the eels, but he knew how the men and women who did must have felt.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  For a moment, Cholik was certain he had killed himself.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then the glowing green sphere flew away from him and slammed into Kabraxis\'92s door. Amplified to titanic proportions, the\plain \f2\i\fs24 boom!\plain \f2\fs24 of magic contacting the door manifested itself as a physical presence that knocked rock from the edges of the door and slammed stalactites from the cavern ceiling.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The stalactites crashed down among the huddled slaves, mercenaries, and fallen Zakarum priests. Cholik somehow retained his own footing while everyone around him toppled. Glancing over his shoulder, the priest saw three men screaming in agony but heard no sound. He felt as though spun cotton filled his head. One of the mercenaries carried on a brief, macabre dance with a stalactite that had transfixed him, then fell over. He spasmed as his life drained away.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  In the silent stillness that had descended upon the cavern, Cholik spoke the fifth and final Word. The elliptical design ignited on the top, outside ring. From its starting point, a blood-red bead traced the ellipses, making them all glow as it hopped from one completed ring to another.{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint67}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint67}Then it darted to the line that ran through them all, moving faster and faster.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  When it reached the end of the design, the bead burst in scarlet glory.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The massive gray-green doors opened, and sound returned to the cavern in a rush. The door shoveled the remaining debris from in front of it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik watched in disbelieving horror as death poured through the open door from some forgotten corner of the Burning Hells.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 The Dyre River ran mostly east and west, flowing through the canyon time had cut through the mountains. The ruins of the city lay on the north bank of the river. The widest part of the city fronted the river, taking advantage of the natural harbor.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93In its day,\'94 Mat said in a low voice, \'93Tauruk\'92s Port must have done all right by itself.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Ignoring the familiar bickering of the two men, which at times was tiresome and at other times proved enjoyable, Darrick took a small spyglass from the bag at his waist. It was one of the few personal possessions he had. A craftsman in Kurast had built the spyglass, but Darrick had purchased it from a merchant in Westmarch. The brass body made the spyglass almost indestructible, and clever design{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint69}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint69}rendered it collapsible. He extended the spyglass and studied the city closer.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick followed the sparse line of pirates and lanterns ashore, focusing at last on a large building that had suffered partial destruction. The building sat under a thick shelf of rock that looked as if it had been displaced by whatever had destroyed the city.

Then he returned his attention to the docks.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Two small docks floated in the water, buoyed on watertight barrels. From the wreckage thrust up farther east of the floating docks, Darrick believed that more permanent docks had once existed there. The broken striations of the land above the river indicated that chunks had cracked off in the past. The permanent docks probably resided in the harbor deep enough that they posed no threats to shallow-drawing ships.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Two block-and-tackle rigs hung from the lip of the riverbank thirty feet above the decks of the three cogs. Stacks of crates and hogshead barrels occupied space beside the block-and-tackles. Ahandful of men guarded the stores, but they were occupied in a game of dice, all of them hunkered down to watch the outcome of every roll. Every now and again a cheer reached Darrick\'92s ears. They had two lanterns between them, placed at opposite ends of the gaming area.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I may have put on a pound or three in the last month or two,\'94 Maldrin admitted, \'93but I\'92ll never get so old or so fat that I can\'92t keep up with ye young pups. If\'92n I do, I\'92ll tie a rope around me neck and dive off the fo\'92c\'92sle.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Then follow along,\'94 Darrick invited. \'93We\'92ll see if we can\'92t take over that stockpile.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick started down the grade, staying along the edge of the river. The block-and-tackles and the guards were nearly two hundred yards away. Brush and small trees grew along the high riverbank. Raithen\'92s pirates had been lazy about clearing more land than necessary.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Unless I misread those barrels,\'94 Darrick said, \'93they contain whale oil and whiskey.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Be better if they contained some of them wizard\'92s potions that explode,\'94 Maldrin said.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We work with what we get,\'94 Darrick said, \'93and we\'92ll be glad about it.\'94 He called for Tomas.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye,\'94 Tomas said, drawing up out of the dark shadows.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Once we give the signal,\'94 Darrick said, \'93bring the rest of the men in a hurry. We\'92ll be boarding the middle ship to look for the king\'92s nephew. When we find him, I\'92ll be having him off that ship soon as we\'92re able. Make use of one of those block-and-tackles.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye,\'94 Tomas replied. \'93We\'92ll fetch him up.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ll be wanting him in one piece, Tomas,\'94 Darrick threatened, \'93or it\'92ll be you explaining to the king how his nephew got himself hurt or dead.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Tomas nodded. \'93A babe in arms, Darrick, that\'92s how{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint72}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint72}we\'92ll be treatin\'92 the boy. As safe as his own mother would have him.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick clapped Tomas on the shoulder and grinned. \'93I knew I was asking the right man about the job.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Just ye be careful down there, an\'92 don\'92t go gettin\'92 too brave until we get down there with ye.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick nodded, then started down the mountainside toward the riverbank. Mat and Maldrin followed him, as silent as falling snow in the winter.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen followed the steps cut into the riverbank overlooking the boats. When the steps had first been cut from the stone of the mountains, they\'92d doubtless been of an even keel. Now, after the damage that had been done to the city, they canted to one side, making the descent a tricky one. Since Raithen\'92s crew had been holed up at Tauruk\'92s Port, more than one drunken pirate had ended up in the water below, and two of them had been swept away in the current and likely drowned by the time they reached the Gulf of Westmarch.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 He carried a lantern to light the way, and the golden glow played over the striations in the mountainside. In the day, the stone shone blue and slate gray, different levels marked by a deepening of color till the rock looked almost charcoal gray before disappearing beneath the river\'92s edge. The fog maintained a soft presence around him, but he saw the three cogs through it without problem.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Pirates assigned to guard duty squared their shoulders and looked alert as he passed. They deferred to him with politeness he\'92d beaten into some of them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A sudden shrill of rope through pulleys alerted him to activity above.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Look alive, ye great bastards,\'94 a rough voice called down. \'93I\'92ve got ye a load of victuals, I have.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Send it on down,\'94 a man called on the cog to Raithen\'92s right. \'93Been waitin\'92 on it a dog\'92s age. Feel like my stomach\'92s been wrappin\'92 itself around me backbone.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Pressing himself against the mountainside, Raithen{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint73}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint73}watched as a short, squat barrel was let go. The pulleys slowed the barrel\'92s descent, proving that the load was light. The scent of salted pork passed within inches of Raithen.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Got you a bottle of wine in there, too,\'94 the man called.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93An\'92 ye damn near hit Cap\'92n Raithen with it, ye lummox,\'94 the guard only a few feet from the pirate captain yelled out.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A muttered curse followed. \'93Excuse me, cap\'92n,\'94 the man said in a contrite voice. \'93Didn\'92t know it was ye.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen held the lantern up so the man could plainly see his features. \'93Hurry up.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye, sir. Right away, sir.\'94 The pirate raised his voice. \'93Ye lads heave off with that barrel. We need another, I\'92ll fetch it up later.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The pirates aboard the first cog threw off the lines, and they were hauled back up the block-and-tackle.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  As soon as the way was clear, Raithen walked to the first of the small temporary docks floating on the black water. He climbed the cargo net tossed over the side of the cog and stepped to the cog\'92s deck.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Evenin\'92, cap\'92n,\'94 a scar-faced pirate greeted. A half dozen other pirates did the same but didn\'92t slow in their efforts to take the food from the barrel.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen nodded at the man, feeling the pain in his wounded throat. When the ships were in port, he made certain the men stayed out of ships\'92 stores. All of the cogs stayed fully loaded at all times, in case they had to flee out to deep water. His other ships lay a few days away, anchored off the north coastline in a bay that could be treacherous to an understaffed ship.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Planks spanned the distance between the ships. The river current was gentle enough that the cogs didn\'92t fight the tether while they lay at anchorage. On board\plain \f2\i\fs24 Barracuda,\plain \f2\fs24 the ship kept between the other two, he saw Bull sitting in the prow puffing on a pipe.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Cap\'92n,\'94 Bull acknowledged, taking the pipe from between his teeth. He was a big man, seemingly assembled from masts. A scarf tied around his head bound his{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint74}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint74}wounded ear, but bloodstains were visible down the sides of his neck.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93How\'92s the boy, Bull?\'94 Raithen asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Why, he\'92s fine, cap\'92n,\'94 Bull replied. \'93Any reason he shouldn\'92t be?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I heard about your ear.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93This little thing?\'94 Bull touched his wounded ear and grinned. \'93Why, it ain\'92t nothing for ye to be worryin\'92 over, cap\'92n.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92m not worrying over it,\'94 Raithen said. \'93I figure any pirate who gets taken in by a boy isn\'92t worth the salt I pay him to crew my ship.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Bull\'92s face darkened, but Raithen knew it was out of embarrassment. \'93It\'92s just that he\'92s such an innocent-lookin\'92 thing, cap\'92n. Didn\'92t figure him for no shenanigans like this. An\'92 that two-by-four? Why, he like to took me plumb by surprise. I\'92m right tempted to keep him fer myself if\'92n the king don\'92t ransom him back. I\'92m tellin\'92 ye true, cap\'92n, we\'92ve done a lot worse than take on somebody like this boy for crew.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ll keep that in mind,\'94 Raithen said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye, sir. I weren\'92t offerin\'92 outta nothin\'92 but respect for ye and that mean-spirited little lad down in the hold.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I want to see him.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Cap\'92n, I swear to ye, I ain\'92t done nothin\'92 to him.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I know, Bull,\'94 Raithen said. \'93My reasons are my own.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye, sir.\'94 Bull took a massive key ring from his waist sash, then knocked the contents of his pipe into the river. No fires except the watch\'92s lanterns were allowed down in the hold, and those were taken there seldom.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Bull walked into the small cargo hold. Raithen followed, inhaling the familiar stink. When he\'92d been with the Westmarch Navy, ships were not allowed to stink so. Sailors had been kept busy cleaning them out, dosing them with salt water and vinegar to kill any fungus or mold that tried to leach into the wood.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The boy was kept in the small brig in the stern of the cog.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint75}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint75}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  After unlocking the brig door, Bull shoved his big head in, then pulled it out just as quickly. He reached up and caught a board aimed at his face, then tugged on it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The boy flopped onto the ship\'92s deck, landing hard on his belly and face. Quick as a fish taken out of water, the boy tried to get to his feet. Bull pinned him to the ship\'92s deck with one massive boot.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Incredibly, the boy revealed a huge knowledge of vituperative name-calling.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Like I said, cap\'92n,\'94 Bull said with a grin, \'93this \'92un here, why, he\'92d make for a fine pirate, he would.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Captain?\'94 the boy squalled. Even trapped under Bull\'92s foot, he craned his head around and tried to gaze up. \'93You\'92re the captain of this pigsty? Why, if I was you, I\'92d sew a bag for my head and only leave myself one eyehole out of embarrassment.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  In the first real amusement he\'92d felt that night, Raithen glanced down at the boy. \'93He\'92s not afraid, Bull?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Afraid?\'94 the boy squealed. \'93I\'92m afraid I\'92m going to die of boredom. You\'92ve had me for five days now. Three of them spent here in this ship. When I get back to my da and he speaks with his brother, the king, why, I\'92ll come back here and help wallop you myself.\'94 He clenched his fists and beat the deck. \'93Let me up, and give me a sword. I\'92ll fight you. By the Light, I\'92ll give you the fight of your life.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Truly taken aback by the boy\'92s demeanor, Raithen studied him. The boy was lean and muscular, starting to lose his baby fat. Raithen guessed he was eleven or twelve, possibly even as much as thirteen. A thick shock of dark hair crowned the boy\'92s head, and the lantern light revealed that he had gray or green eyes.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Do you even know where you\'92re at, boy?\'94 Raithen asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93When the king\'92s navy pays you off or tracks you down,\'94 the boy said, \'93I\'92ll know where you are. Don\'92t you think that I won\'92t.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Squatting down, holding the lantern close to the boy\'92s face, Raithen shook the dagger sheathed along his arm free{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint76}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint76}again. He rammed the point into the wooden deck only an inch from the boy\'92s nose.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The last person to threaten me tonight,\'94 Raithen said in a hoarse voice, \'93died only minutes ago. I won\'92t mind killing another.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The boy\'92s eyes focused on the knife. He swallowed hard but remained silent.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ll have your name, boy,\'94 Raithen said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Lhex,\'94 the boy whispered. \'93My name is Lhex.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And you are the king\'92s nephew?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen turned the knife blade, catching the lantern light and splintering it. \'93How many sons does your father have?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Five. Counting me.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Will he miss one of them?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lhex swallowed again. \'93Yes.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Good.\'94 Raithen raised the lantern, getting it out of the boy\'92s eyes and letting him see the smile on his face. \'93This doesn\'92t have to go hard for you, boy. But I mean to have the information I came here for tonight.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I don\'92t know anything.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We\'92ll see.\'94 Raithen stood. \'93Get him up, Bull. I\'92ll talk to him in the brig.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Bending down, keeping his foot in place, Bull caught the boy\'92s shirt in one massive hand and lifted him. Without apparent effort, he carried the boy back into the small brig. With exaggerated gentleness, Bull placed the boy against the far wall, then stood by him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You can leave, Bull,\'94 Raithen said.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I can handle a small boy,\'94 Raithen said, hanging the lantern on a hook on the wall. He took the key from Bull and sent the pirate on his way with a look. Gripping the bars of the door with one hand, Raithen closed the door. The clang of metal on metal sounded loud in the enclosed space.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint77}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint77}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lhex started to get to his feet.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Don\'92t stand,\'94 Raithen warned. \'93If you insist on standing, I\'92ll use this dagger and nail you to the wall behind you by one hand.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Freezing halfway to his feet, Lhex looked at Raithen. The look was one of childhood innocence and daring, trying to ascertain if the pirate captain had meant what he\'92d said.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Evidently, Lhex decided he would, too. Grimacing, the boy sat, but he did so with stubbornness, keeping his knees drawn up and placing his back securely against the wall behind him.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen ignored the question. The information had come from Buyard Cholik\'92s spies within Westmarch. \'93What were you doing in Lut Gholein?\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Until you worked the bed support loose and attacked Bull,\plain \f2\fs24 Raithen thought. He stepped forward, respecting the boy\'92s skills and focus. Most boys Lhex\'92s age would have been sniveling wrecks by now. Instead, the king\'92s nephew had busied himself with planning escape, conserving energy, and eating to keep himself healthy and strong.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lhex took the paper Raithen offered. His quick eyes darted over the paper. Hesitantly, he traced the design with his forefinger.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Where did you get this?\'94 Lhex asked in a quiet voice.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The cog shifted in the river, and water slapped against the hull, echoing throughout the ship. Raithen rode out the change in the ship without much thought. \'93It doesn\'92t matter. Do you know what it is?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes,\'94 the boy said. \'93This is some kind of demon script. That symbol belongs to Kabraxis, the demon who supposedly constructed the Black Road.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen drew back and scoffed. \'93There are no such things as demons, boy.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93My teachers taught me to have an open mind. Maybe demons aren\'92t here now, but that doesn\'92t mean that they were never here.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen peered at the paper, trying to make sense of it. \'93Can you read it?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Raithen said. \'93They\'92re only good for stories best told in taverns or over a slow campfire when there\'92s nothing else to do.\'94 Still, the boy\'92s words had intrigued him.\plain \f2\i\fs24 The priest is here hunting a demon?\plain \f2\fs24 He couldn\'92t believe it. \'93What else can you tell me about this design?\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A trail scarred the mountainside, running parallel to the Dyre River. Darrick was certain Raithen\'92s pirate crew used it when changing the guard. He stayed off it, choosing the slower path through the brush.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat and Maldrin followed him, staying to the path he chose.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  As they neared the riverbank\'92s edge overlooking the three pirate vessels, wisps of silver fog threaded through the brush. Tobacco smoke itched Darrick\'92s nose. Though Captain Tollifer didn\'92t allow smoking on\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star,\plain \f2\fs24 Darrick had been around a number of men who smoked in ports they patrolled and traded with. He\'92d never acquired the habit himself and thought it was repugnant. And it reminded him of his father\'92s pipe.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The brush and treeline ended twenty yards short of the area the pirates had been using to shift their stolen goods. Shadows painted the stacks of crates and barrels, giving him more cover to take advantage of.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  One of the pirates walked away from the group of five who played dice. \'93That ale\'92s gettin\'92 the best of me. Hold my place. I\'92ll be back.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93As long as ye have money,\'94 one of the other pirates said, \'93we\'92ll stand ye to a place in this game. This is yer unlucky night and our lucky one.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Just be glad Cap\'92n Raithen\'92s been keepin\'92 us headed toward fat purses,\'94 the pirate said. He walked around to the side of the crates where Darrick hid in the brush.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick thought the man was going to relieve himself over the side of the riverbank and was surprised to see him{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint81}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint81}dig in the bag at his side frantically once he was out of sight of the others. Pale moonlight touched the dice that tumbled out into the man\'92s waiting palm.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The pirate grinned and closed his fist over the dice. Then he started to relieve himself.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Moving with catlike grace, Darrick crept up behind the pirate. Picking up a stone loose on the ground, Darrick fisted it and stepped behind the pirate, who was humming a shanty tune as he finished. Darrick recognized the tune as \'93Amergo and the Dolphin Girl,\'94 a bawdy favorite of a number of sailors.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick swung the stone, felt the thud of rock meeting flesh, and wrapped an arm around the unconscious pirate to guide him to the ground. Leaving the fallen pirate out of sight from the others, Darrick slid to the riverbank\'92s edge. He peered down, seeing that all three cogs did lie at anchorage beneath the overhang as he\'92d thought.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He drew back, put his shoulders to the crate behind him, slid his cutlass free, and waved to Maldrin and Mat. They crossed, staying low.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Hey, Timar,\'94 one of the pirates called, \'93ye comin\'92 back tonight?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Told ye he had too much to drink,\'94 another pirate said. \'93Probably start cheatin\'92 any minute now.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93If\'92n I see them loaded dice of his one more time,\'94 another pirate said, \'93I swear I\'92m gonna cut his nose off.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick glanced up the slight rise of land toward the ruins of Tauruk\'92s Port. No one came down the trail that wound through the wreckage.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Four men left,\'94 Darrick whispered. \'93Once one of them makes a noise, there\'92ll be no more hiding here for us.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat nodded.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Maldrin slitted his eyes and ran a thumb across the knife in his fist. \'93Better they not have a chance to make noise, then.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Agreed,\'94 Darrick whispered. \'93Maldrin, hold the steps.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat raised his eyebrows.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Barrels of whale oil,\'94 Darrick said. \'93Shouldn\'92t be that hard to get them over the edge of the riverbank.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick smiled, feeling cocky as he always did when he was in the thick of a potentially disastrous situation. \'93If we live, you owe me a beer back at Rik\'92s Tavern in Westmarch.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I owe ye?\'94 Maldrin looked as though he couldn\'92t believe it. \'93An\'92 how is it ye\'92re a-gonna buy me one?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Shrugging, Darrick said, \'93If I get us all killed, I\'92ll stand you to your first cool drink in the Burning Hells.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Maldrin protested. \'93That\'92s not fair.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Speak up first next time, and you can set the terms,\'94 Darrick said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Timar!\'94 one of the pirates bellowed.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93He\'92s probably fallen in,\'94 another pirate said. \'93I\'92ll go look for him.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick rose slowly, looking over the stack of crates as one of the pirates peeled off from the game. He held his cutlass in his hand, signaling Mat and Maldrin to stand down. If fortune was going to favor them with one more victim before they set to, so be it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  When the man stepped around the crates, Darrick grabbed him, clapped a hand over the pirate\'92s mouth, and slit his throat with the cutlass. Darrick held the man as he bled out. A look of horror filled Mat\'92s face.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick looked away from the accusation he found in{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint83}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint83}his friend\'92s eyes. Mat could kill to save a friend or a shipmate in the heat of battle, but killing as Darrick had just done was beyond him. To Darrick, there was no remorse or guilt involved.

Some of the stories are based on incidents that might have or might not have involved demons, but many are total fabrications. Or a story has been fractured, retold, and made more current. Old wives\'92 tales. Harsus, the toad-faced demon of Kurast\'97if he even existed\'97has become four different demons in the local histories.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93During the Mage Clan Wars. There was some rumor that one of Kreghn\'92s disciples had managed to open a portal to Kabraxis again, but that was never confirmed.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93How was Kabraxis banished from this world?\'94 Raithen asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93According to legend, by Vizjerei warriors and wizards of the Spirit Clan,\'94 Lhex replied, \'93and by those who stood with them.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen considered that. \'93If a man could contact Kabraxis\'97\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen thought of Buyard Cholik\'92s body bent with old age and approaching infirmity. \'93Aye, maybe it would at that.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Where did you find that?\'94 Lhex asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Before Raithen could respond, the door opened, and Bull stepped inside.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Cap\'92n Raithen,\'94 the big pirate said, holding a lantern high. Concern stretched his features tight. \'93We\'92re under attack.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Only a few steps short of the pirate about to scream out, Darrick leapt into the air. The other two pirates who had been playing dice reached for their weapons as Darrick\'92s feet slammed into the pirate\'92s head.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Caught by surprise and by all of Darrick\'92s weight, almost too drunk to stand, the pirate flew over the steep side of the riverbank. He didn\'92t even scream. The hard{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint89}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint89}thump told Darrick that the pirate had struck the wooden deck of the ship below instead of the river.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What the hell was that?\'94 a pirate called out from below.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick landed on the bare stone ground, bruising his hip. He clutched his cutlass and swiped at the nearest pirate\'92s legs, slashing both thighs. Blood stained the man\'92s light-colored breeches.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Help!\'94 the stricken pirate yelled. \'93Ahoy the ship! Damn it, but he\'92s cut me deep!\'94 He stumbled backward, trying to pull his sword free of its sash but forgetting to release the ale bottle he already held.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Pushing himself up and drawing the cutlass back again, Darrick drove the pirate backward, close to the riverbank\'92s edge. He whipped the cutlass around and chopped into the pirate\'92s neck, cleaving his throat in a bloody spray. The cutlass blade lodged against the man\'92s spine. Lifting his foot, Darrick shoved the dying man over the riverbank. He turned, listening to the splash as the pirate hit the water only a moment later, and saw Mat engaging the final pirate on guard at the supply station.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat\'92s cutlass sparked as he pressed his opponent\'92s guard. He penetrated the pirate\'92s guard easily, hesitating about drawing blood.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cursing beneath his breath, knowing that they had precious little time to rescue the boy and that they didn\'92t know for sure if he was aboard the ship waiting below, Darrick stepped forward and brought his cutlass down in a hand-and-a-half stroke that split the man\'92s skull. Acutlass wasn\'92t a fancy weapon; it was meant to hack and cleave because shipboard battles on vessels riding the waves tended to be messy things guided mostly by desperation and strength and luck.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Blood from the dead man splashed over Mat and onto Darrick.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat looked appalled as the pirate dropped. Darrick knew his friend didn\'92t approve of the blow dealt from behind or while the pirate had already been engaging one opponent. Mat believed in fighting fairly whenever possible.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint90}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint90}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Get the barrels,\'94 Darrick urged, yanking his sword from the dead man\'92s head.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93He didn\'92t even see you comin\'92,\'94 Mat protested, looking down at the dead man.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The barrels,\'94 Darrick repeated.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93He was too drunk to fight,\'94 Mat said. \'93He couldn\'92t have defended himself.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We\'92re not here to fight,\'94 Darrick said, grabbing Mat\'92s bloody shirtfront. \'93We\'92re here to save a twelve-year-old boy. Now,\plain \f2\i\fs24 move!\'94\plain \f2\fs24 He shoved Mat at the oil barrels. \'93There\'92s plenty of fair fights left down there if you\'92re wanting for them.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat stumbled toward the oil barrels.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Thrusting his cutlass into his waist sash, Darrick listened to the hue and cry taken up from the ships below. He glanced at the top of the stone steps carved into the side of the overhang.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Maldrin had taken up a position at the top of the steps. The first mate held a war hammer with a metal-shod haft in both hands. The hammer took both hands to wield, but the squared head promised crushed skulls, broken bones, or shattered weapons.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93 \'92Ware arrows, Maldrin,\'94 Darrick called.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A sour grin twisted the first mate\'92s mouth. \'93 \'92Ware yer own arse there, skipper. Ain\'92t me gonna be goin\'92 after that there boy.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick kicked a barrel over onto its side. The thick liquid inside glugged. Working with haste, he got behind the barrel and used his hands to roll it toward the riverbank\'92s edge. The downward slope favored the rolling barrel.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  After he got it started, he knew he couldn\'92t have easily stopped the barrel\'92s momentum. Giving the barrel a final shove, he watched it roll over the edge and disappear. He stopped at the edge, teetering for a moment, and gazed down, spotting the falling barrel just as it smashed against the ship\'92s deck below. Wisps of fog slid over the deck, but silvery patches showed through where the whale oil reflected the lantern lights of the pirate guards on watch.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint91}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint91}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Another smash caught Darrick\'92s attention. Glancing to the side, he saw that Mat had succeeded in landing an oil barrel on the other cog. Pirates ran out onto the deck and lost their footing, skidding across the wooden surface.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Oil!\'94 a pirate cried out. \'93They\'92ve done an\'92 rolled a barrel of oil onto us!\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hustling back to the stacked barrels, Darrick kicked over two more containers and started them rolling for the riverbank. The thunderous clatter of the wooden barrels slamming against the stone surface echoed around him. He took up one of the lanterns the men on guard had carried.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat joined him, grabbing another lantern. \'93Them men down there, Darrick, they ain\'92t going to have many places to run once we up and do this.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Darrick agreed, looking into his friend\'92s troubled face, \'93and we aren\'92t going to have much running room, either, once we have the boy. I don\'92t want to have to look over my shoulder for those ships, Mat.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Nodding grimly, Mat turned and sprinted for the riverbank.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick paused only long enough to see the rest of the crew from\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star\plain \f2\fs24 racing from the mountainside. \'93Help\'92s coming, Maldrin,\'94 he shouted as he ran for the river.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I got what I got here,\'94 Maldrin growled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  At the edge of the river, Darrick marked his spot, judged the rise and fall of the cog on the river current, and threw the lantern. Protected by the glass, the flame remained alive and burning brightly in the lantern. It flew, twisting end over end till it smashed against the ship\'92s deck in the center of the spreading oil pool.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  For a moment, the wick sputtered and almost drowned in the oil. Then the flames rose up across the oil like an arthritic old hound rising for one last hunt. Blue and yellow flames twisted into a roiling mass as they fed on the wind as well as the oil.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Fire!\'94 a pirate yelled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A flurry of action filled the ship\'92s deck as the pirates{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint92}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint92}gathered from belowdecks. Only a skeleton crew remained aboard.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Save those ships!\'94 another pirate roared. \'93Cap\'92n Raithen will kill ye if\'92n these ships go down!\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick hoped all the ships burned down to the waterline. If they did, he knew there was a chance Captain Tollifer would be able to sail\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star\plain \f2\fs24 to Westmarch and return with more ships and warriors in time to catch Raithen and his crew crossing overland to wherever the pirate captain had left his main flotilla.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Glancing to the ship Mat had dropped the barrel on, Darrick saw that it had caught fire as well. Evidently Mat\'92s barrel had caught the wheelhouse, too, giving the flames the reach they needed to get into the sails. Fire blazed along the main mast, threading up through the rigging in a rush.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Mat,\'94 Darrick called.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat looked at him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Are you ready?\'94 Darrick asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Looking only a little unsure of himself, Mat nodded. \'93As I ever was.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Going to be me and you down there,\'94 Darrick said. \'93I need you to stand with me.\'94 He hurried toward the middle of the riverbank, aiming himself at the middle ship, stretching out his stride.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ll be there for you,\'94 Mat answered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Without pausing, Darrick took a final step at the edge of the riverbank overhang, hurling himself toward the cog\'92s railing, hoping he could make the distance. If he fell to the ship\'92s deck, he was certain to break something. Escape would be out of the question.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Even as Darrick\'92s hands reached for the rigging, fingers outspread to hook into the ropes, the riverbank overhang shattered, shrugging off a section of heavy rock that dropped toward the burning ships and the whole one.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Under attack from whom?\'94 Raithen demanded, turning toward the door. Automatically, he started walking{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint93}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint93}toward the door. His head was so filled with the sheer impossibility of the attack that he didn\'92t recognize the rustle of clothing for what it was until it was too late. He turned, knowing Lhex had chosen that moment to make his move.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Don\'92t know,\'94 Bull said. \'93They done went an\'92 set fire to the cogs on either side of us.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Fire?\plain \f2\fs24 Raithen thought, and there wasn\'92t a more fearsome announcement that could be made aboard a ship. Even if a vessel were holed, a crew might be able to pump the hold dry and keep her afloat till they reached port, but an unchecked fire quickly took away the island of wood and canvas a sailing man depended on.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  As close to Bull as he was and with the announcement so new, Raithen\'92s and the big man\'92s attention was on each other, not the boy. Lhex was up behind Raithen in a twinkling. As the pirate captain turned to grab the boy, the young captive bent low, stepped in hard against Raithen to knock him against Bull, and was through the door before anyone could stop him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Damn it,\'94 Raithen swore, watching the boy speed through the darkness in the hold and run for the stairs leading up to the deck. \'93Get him, Bull. But I\'92ll want him alive when you bring him back.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye, cap\'92n.\'94 Bull took off at once, closing the distance swiftly with his long stride.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen followed the pirate, his left hand tight on his sword hilt. Already he could see the bright light of a large fire through the cargo hold above them. Gray tendrils of smoke mixed with the fog clinging to the river.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He\'92d been right. Someone had trailed them for a time through the Gulf of Westmarch. But was it other pirates, or was it the king\'92s navy? Were there only a few men out there, or was there a small armada choking down the river?
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The ladder to the main deck quivered and shook in Raithen\'92s hands as Bull climbed it. He was at the bigger man\'92s heels and had just reached the top when the riverbank\'92s{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint94}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint94}overhang cracked and sheared off thirty feet above them. He gazed upward in disbelief as sections of the overhang plummeted down like catapult loads.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A huge granite block dropped onto\plain \f2\i\fs24 Barracuda\'92\plain \f2\fs24 s prow. The impact cracked timbers and tore sections of railing free.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Barracuda\plain \f2\fs24 rocked as if she\'92d been seized in a fierce gale.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A lantern tumbled loose from the hand of a pirate who had been knocked from his feet. Skidding across the wooden deck, the lantern swapped ends several times before disappearing over the ship\'92s side.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Gaining the deck, keeping his knees bent to ride out the violent tossing of\plain \f2\i\fs24 Barracuda\plain \f2\fs24 fighting her mooring ropes, Raithen looked at the other two ships. Both cogs were fast on their way to becoming pyres. Flames already twisted through the rigging of the port ship, and the starboard ship wasn\'92t far behind.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Who the hell has done this?
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Ahead of him, the boy had almost used up all his running room. He stood with his back to the edge of the swaying ship\'92s deck. The look he gave the black water around the ship indicated that he was in no hurry to try his luck with a swim.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Bull closed on the boy, yelling filth at him, ordering him to stay put.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen yelled at his crew, ordering them to break out buckets and attempt to save both burning cogs. If their hiding place had been discovered, he wanted all of the ships so he could haul away as much as he could.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kegs and crates floated in the river around\plain \f2\i\fs24 Barracuda,\plain \f2\fs24 but some of them sank only a moment later. Feeling the fat-assed way the cog sat in the river, Raithen knew she was taking on water. The impact that had struck the prow must have ruptured the ship as well. At least part of the damage was below the waterline.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Surveying the cracked riverbank overhang high overhead, Raithen knew the destruction wasn\'92t a natural occurrence. Something had happened to cause it. His mind{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint95}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint95}immediately flew to Buyard Cholik. The ruins the priests poked through were underground. The pirate captain had a fleeting thought, wondering if the old priest had survived his own greed.

Despite the sudden explosion that had taken out the line of supplies perched on the cliff\'92s edge, he\'92d landed aboard the pirate vessel. His hands still ached from grabbing the coarse hemp rope.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \'93You made it,\'94 Darrick said, cutting the ratline free.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Barely,\'94 Mat agreed. \'93An\'92 where is that fabulous luck of mine ye were braggin\'92 about earlier? That damned cliffside blew up.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93But not us with it,\'94 Darrick argued. The brief glance he had of the two burning cogs gave him a chance to feel proud of their handiwork. He checked the stone steps and saw Maldrin pushing himself to his feet. The explosion had knocked the first mate from his feet.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93There\'92s the boy,\'94 Mat said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick scanned the deck below and saw the small figure chased into the broken prow by the huge man who followed him. He had little doubt that the boy was the king\'92s nephew. There couldn\'92t be many boys on the pirate vessels.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Darrick!\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Looking up, Darrick saw Tomas standing on the cliffside near the surviving block-and-tackle rig. The other had gone down with the explosion that had restructured the riverbank.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Tomas waved.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Get it down here,\'94 Darrick ordered. He took hold of the ratline and swung himself from the rigging. Even with the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint97}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint97}ship foundering in the river\'97taking on water, he judged\'97he arced out past the big man cornering the small boy. Reaching the end of his swing, he started back, aiming himself at the big man.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Bull!\'94 a pirate behind the big man yelled in warning.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The big man glanced around instead of up, though, never seeing Darrick until it was too late.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Bending his knees a little to absorb the shock better, Darrick drove both feet into the big man, catching him across the shoulders. Even then, Darrick felt his knees strain with the impact, and for a moment he didn\'92t think the man was going to budge and was going to smash up against him like a wave shredding over a reef.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But the big man tore free of the deck, sprawling forward, unable to stop himself.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hurting and winded from the impact, Darrick released the ratline and dropped to the deck only a few feet from the boy. Scrambling to his feet immediately, Darrick drew his cutlass.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Get him,\'94 a tall man in black chainmail ordered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick got set in time to meet two pirates who rushed him. He slapped their weapons aside with the flat of the cutlass, then stepped in, turned, and elbowed one of the pirates in the face. The man\'92s nose broke with a savage snap. It wasn\'92t the honorable thing to do, but Darrick knew he wasn\'92t up against honorable opponents. The pirates would shove a blade into his back as quickly as he\'92d do it to them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The pirate with the broken nose staggered to one side, blood smearing his face. But he didn\'92t go down.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Still in motion, Darrick plucked a dagger from his boot, spun, and shoved it between the pirate\'92s ribs, ripping it through the man\'92s chest and planting it in the heart beneath. He kept moving, getting his cutlass up to parry the other pirate\'92s clumsy attack and riposting.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat landed on the ship\'92s deck only a heartbeat later.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Get the boy,\'94 Darrick ordered. Then he raised his voice. \'93Tomas!\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye, skipper,\'94 Tomas called from above. \'93On its way.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick defended against the pirate\'92s attempt to skewer him, aware that the mountain of a man was getting to his feet as well. From the corner of his eye, Darrick saw the block-and-tackle lower, a small cargo net at the end of it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Lhex,\'94 Mat said, holding up his empty hands and offering no threat. \'93Be easy, boy. Me friend\plain \f2\i\fs24 an\'92\plain \f2\fs24 I, why, we\'92re in the king\'92s navy, come here to see you to home safe. If you\'92ll allow us.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The cargo net hit the bucking ship\'92s deck in a loose sprawl of hemp.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes,\'94 the boy said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Good.\'94 Mat smiled at him, reaching for the cargo netting and dragging it toward the boy. \'93Then let\'92s be away.\'94 He raised his voice. \'93Darrick.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93In a minute,\'94 Darrick replied, bracing himself for the coming battle. He flicked the pirate\'92s sword aside with his cutlass, then nipped in with a low blow, ducked and caught the pirate under the arm with his shoulder, and used his strength to lever the man over the ship\'92s side.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Get over here,\'94 the man in black chainmail ordered pirates on the starboard vessel.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick turned to confront the big man, noticing the bandage that covered the side of his head. When he parried the man\'92s blade, testing his strength, Darrick found the man uncommonly strong.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The big man grinned, filled with confidence.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Ducking beneath the big man\'92s blow, Darrick stepped to one side and drove a foot into the side of his opponent\'92s knee. Something popped, but the big man somehow remained on his feet, turning again with a sword cut that would have taken Darrick\'92s head from his shoulders if it had struck.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Moving as swiftly as a striking serpent, Darrick kicked the man in the groin. When the man bent over in pain, Darrick performed a spinning back kick that caught the big man on the wounded side of his head. He howled in agony and went down, holding his head.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The man in black chainmail stepped forward, raising his{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint99}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint99}blade into the\plain \f2\i\fs24 en garde\plain \f2\fs24 position. He set to without a word, his sword flashing before him with considerable skill. \'93I am Raithen, captain of this ship. And you\'92re one breath away from being a dead man.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Without warning, the swordfight took on a deadly earnestness. As skilled as he was, Darrick was hard pressed to keep the pirate captain\'92s blade from finding his throat, eyes, or groin. Nothing was off-limits for the man\'92s sword. Dead, blind, or unmanned, it appeared Captain Raithen would take Darrick any way he could get him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Still howling in furious pain, the big man rose from the ship\'92s deck and rushed at Darrick. The scarf over the man\'92s head had turned dark with fresh blood. Darrick knew he hadn\'92t caused the wound, only aggravated a fresh one.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Bull!\'94 Raithen commanded. \'93No! Stay back!\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Enraged and hurting, the big man didn\'92t hear his captain or ignored him. He ran at Darrick, sweeping his big sword behind him, preparing a blow that completely lacked finesse. Bull interfered with his captain\'92s attack, causing Raithen to draw back before he overexposed himself.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Giving ground before the big man, Darrick noticed that Mat had the boy secure and safe in the cargo net. \'93Tomas, pull them up.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Darrick,\'94 Mat called.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Shadows spun with wild abandon across the ship\'92s deck as nearby lanterns shifted with the ship\'92s rise and fall on the river current. The crews aboard the other two cogs were fighting losing battles; the flames were going to claim them both within minutes. The heat rolled over Darrick as Tomas and his crew started pulling on the ropes, hauling the cargo net up to the cliffside.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Darrick!\'94 Mat called, concern thick in his voice.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Stay with the boy,\'94 Darrick ordered. \'93I want him clear of this.\'94 He threw himself back from the big man\'92s blow, sliding across the ship\'92s deck in a rolling rush, coming once more to his feet as Bull bore down on him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint100}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint100}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Aware that the cargo netting was quickly rising and that the crew on the other cog had succeeded in spanning the distance between the ships with an oak plank, Darrick took two running steps forward, guessing the distance between himself and Bull. He leapt forward, tucking his chin into his chest, and hurled himself into a front flip just as the big man started his blow.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Upside down, in the middle of the flip, Darrick watched as Bull\'92s cutlass blade passed within inches of him. The pirate\'92s blow pulled Darrick off-balance, causing him to bend over slightly. Darrick landed on his feet on Bull\'92s shoulders and back, got his balance between heartbeats to manage a standing position, and leapt up.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Keeping one hand on his cutlass, stretching his arm as far as he could, Darrick focused on the cargo net being hauled up above him. He tried to curl his fingers in the cargo net, missed by inches.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then Mat caught him, closing a powerful hand around his wrist, refusing to let him fall even as gravity pulled at him. \'93I\'92ve got ye, Darrick.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hanging by his arm, Darrick watched as Raithen shook his hand. Something metallic glinted in the pirate captain\'92s hand as he drew his arm back to throw. When the pirate\'92s arm snapped forward, Darrick spotted the slender form of the throwing knife hurtling at him with unerring accuracy. Torchlight splintered along the razor-sharp length. Moving before he had time to think, knowing he couldn\'92t dodge, Darrick swung the cutlass.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Metal rang as the cutlass blade knocked the throwing knife away. Darrick\'92s breath locked at the back of his throat.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Damn, Darrick,\'94 Mat said, \'93I\'92ve never seen the like.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It\'92s your luck,\'94 Darrick said, looking down into the angry face of the pirate captain who was powerless to stop them. Feeling cocky and damn fortunate to be alive, Darrick saluted Raithen with his sword blade. \'93Another time.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen turned from him, yelling orders to his crew, getting them organized.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Spinning under the cargo net as it continued up, Darrick{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint101}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint101}saw the stone steps where Maldrin encountered a pirate. With a short series of sweeps with the war hammer, the first mate knocked the pirate clear of the steps and sent him plunging down into the river harbor.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then hands grabbed onto the cargo netting and pulled it to the cliffside.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick caught the cliff edge and hauled himself up as Mat sliced through the cargo net with his sword, spilling himself and the king\'92s nephew out onto the cracked stone surface.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The boy pushed himself to his feet. Blood oozed from cuts on his forehead, his nose, and the lobe of one ear as he took in all the destruction of the cliffside. He swung his head to face Darrick. \'93Did you and your men do this?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Darrick said, scanning the ruins. All of them seemed to have changed and shifted. The building they had noticed being used by the pirates had disappeared under a pile of rubble.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The boy pushed away from Mat, who had been checking him over to make certain he was not badly wounded. Cold wind poured down through the Hawk\'92s Beak Mountains, ruffling the boy\'92s hair.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What have they done?\'94 the boy asked in a dry voice. \'93Kabraxis is only a myth. The gate to the Burning Hells is only a myth.\'94 He looked up at Darrick. \'93Isn\'92t it?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick had no answer for the boy.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A horde of demonic flying insects flew out of the yawning mouth of the demon\'92s door toward Buyard Cholik.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lifting his arms, speaking over the dreadful moaning of the insects\'92 wings, and trying not to give in to the stark fear that nearly overwhelmed him, the old priest spoke the words of a protection spell. He didn\'92t know if it would have an effect on the creatures, but he knew he couldn\'92t hope to run in the shape he was in.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The insects passed Cholik by. A streaming mass of turquoise and bottle-green carapaces and wings illuminated by the torches and lanterns used to light the work area cut through the still air of the cavern. Reaching the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint102}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint102}front line of slaves, the insects shot into the victims like arrows, burying deeply into their bodies, ripping through clothing to get at the flesh beneath.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The slaves screamed, but their agony was scarcely heard over the drone of insect wings.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Curious and appalled, hoping they would prove to be enough of a sacrifice to a demon, Cholik watched as the slaves jerked up from their hiding places. The insects writhed within the slaves\'92 flesh, looking like dozens of growths and abscesses. Insane with pain and the horror of their situation, the slaves tried to run. Most didn\'92t take more than three or four steps before their bodies burst open and they dropped to the cavern floor. Several torches fell with them, leaving individual fires burning in a line back toward the entrance.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  In seconds, more than half of the slaves, mercenaries, and priests lay dead, their bones picked clean by the demonic insects, bloody white skeletons gleaming in the torchlight. While the demonic insects stripped victims of their flesh, it looked as if a blood mist had dawned in the air. Abandoning the dead, the insects flew up to the cavern roof and took refuge among the stalactites. Their buzzing quieted only somewhat as they became spectators to the next events.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Buyard Cholik stared into the dark recesses of the open door ahead of him. Fear settled bone-deep into him, but it wasn\'92t fear of what lay ahead of him. True, there was some fear of the unknown. But the greatest fear he had was that the power he found on the other side of that door wouldn\'92t be enough to take away all the damage that the sands of time had wrought.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Or, possibly, that the power on the other side of the door would find him lacking or wouldn\'92t want him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Being rejected by a demon after stepping away from the Zakarum Church was horrible to contemplate.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Master,\'94 Altharin whispered. Somehow the man had escaped the destruction that had stricken most of the people around Cholik. \'93Master, we should go.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint103}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint103}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Then go,\'94 Cholik said without looking at the man.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93This is an evil place,\'94 Altharin said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Of course it is.\'94 Cholik pulled his robes around himself, took a final breath, and marched toward the door to meet his fate.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Even at the open doorway, all Cholik could see was the unending darkness stretching before him. He paused for an instant at the threshold, tempted to call out. Would a demon answer if he spoke? He didn\'92t know. The texts he\'92d read that had given him the information to come this far had not suggested anything past this point.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Somewhere ahead, if the texts were right, Kabraxis waited for the man who would free him into the world again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A cold breeze whipped out of the yawning space before the old priest. Perhaps he would have turned around then, but the cold only reminded Cholik of the chill awaiting him in a grave. It was better to die suddenly tonight than to have to live with all his hopes shattered and stillborn.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But even better than that would be to live with the success of his efforts.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He stepped forward and entered the dark room. Immediately, the steady drone of the insects hidden against the cavern roof dimmed. He knew it wasn\'92t because he\'92d simply entered another cavern in the cave systems beneath Ransim and beneath Tauruk\'92s Port. The noise dimmed because in that one step he moved a long way from the cavern.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The chill burned into Cholik\'92s flesh, but his fear and his determination to stave off death drove him on. With the lighted cavern behind him, he could see the narrow walls of the tunnel on either side of him as he passed but still nothing of what lay ahead.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  You are a man,\plain \f2\fs24 a deep voice boomed inside the priest\'92s head.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Surprised, Cholik almost faltered. \'93Yes,\'94 he said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Only a weak man. And you seek to face a demon?\plain \f2\fs24 The voice sounded amused.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint104}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint104}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Humans have slain demons,\'94 Cholik said, continuing forward through the narrow tunnel.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Not slain them,\plain \f2\fs24 the deep voice insisted.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Merely succeeded in binding demons from your world. But only for a time. Diablo has returned. Others were never forced away. Still others remain in hiding, not even known of.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You were forced away,\'94 Cholik said.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Do you taunt me, human?
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Cholik said, gathering all his courage. The ancient texts hadn\'92t suggested anything about what would transpire on this side of the door, but he knew from other readings that demons despised fear. It was a tool, like a blacksmith\'92s hammer, that was used to bend and shape the human lives they controlled. Meeting a demon meant controlling the fear.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Don\'92t lie to yourself, human. You fear me.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93As I would fear falling from a high cliff,\'94 Cholik agreed. \'93Yet to climb, a man must face the fear of falling and overcome it.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  And have you overcome your fear?
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik licked his lips. All the aches and pains of his advanced years settled into him again, letting him know the spell he\'92d worked to strip the life energy from the slave was being undone. \'93I have more to fear from living my life trapped in a failing shell of a body than I do of dying suddenly.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  I am a demon, Buyard Cholik. Don\'92t you know that you risk dying for centuries?
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik stumbled a little in the darkness. He hadn\'92t thought about that. In the years he\'92d studied Kabraxis and the Black Road, he\'92d only pursued knowledge. After winning Raithen over to his side to supply him with slaves and provide transport, he had thought only of digging the ruins of Ransim out to discover the door.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik made his voice strong. \'93You seek a way out of your prison, Lord Kabraxis. I can be that way.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  You? As frail and weak and near to death as you are?\plain \f2\fs24 The demon laughed, and the hollow booming noise trapped in{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint105}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint105}the tunnel sounded caustic and vibrated through Cholik\'92s body.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You can make me whole and strong again,\'94 Cholik said. \'93You can return my youth to me. I\'92ve read that you have that power. You need a man young in years to help you regain the power that you once had in my world.\'94 He paused. \'93You can make me that man.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Do you believe that?
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes.\'94 And Buyard Cholik believed in the demon\'92s power as much as he\'92d believed in anything the Zakarum Church had taught him. If one was false, then it all was false. But if it was true\'97
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Then come, Buyard Cholik, once priest of the Zakarum Church and friend to no demon. Come and let us see what can be made of you.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Nervous fear and anticipation welled up inside the old priest. Sickness coiled inside his stomach, and for a moment he thought he was going to throw up. He centered himself, using all the techniques he\'92d learned while serving the church, and forced his tired, aching body forward.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A star dawned in the darkness before him, spreading gossamer silver light in all directions. The stone walls on either side melted away, revealing only the darkness of the night. He was not enclosed; he stood on a trail suspended over the longest drop he had ever seen. Visibility ended below the path he walked on, and only then did he realize that he was no longer standing on a stone floor but on a swaying bridge of human bones.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Arm bones, leg bones, and ribs made up the bridge, intermixed with the occasional skull that was complete or damaged. Cholik slowed, feeling the bridge shift dizzyingly beneath him. A skull slid out of place ahead, then bumped and rattled and rolled down the bridge, finally striking a hip bone and bouncing over the bridge\'92s side.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik watched the skull fall, the broken jaw hanging askew as if it were screaming. The skull fell for a long time, tumbling end over end, finally disappearing from the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint106}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint106}reach of the silver star that waited at the end of the bridge. Only then did Cholik realize the bones were not mortared together; they lay crisscrossed, interlocking to provide support for anyone who crossed the bridge.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Would you go back, Buyard Cholik?
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Before he could stop himself, Cholik glanced back along the bridge. Some distance behind him, how far he couldn\'92t tell, the rectangular doorway that opened back into the cavern under the ruins of Ransim gaped. The torches and lanterns flickered inside the cavern, and the stripped skeletons lay on the uneven floor. Thoughts of returning to the apparent safety of the cavern wound through Cholik\'92s mind.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  An explosion shook the bridge, and Cholik watched in dismay as a section of crossed bones blew high above the bridge. The displaced bones fell through the darkness like leaves, drifting and spinning.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The gap left in the bridge was too far for Cholik to leap. The old priest realized he was trapped on the bridge.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Let that be your first lesson,\plain \f2\fs24 the demon said.\plain \f2\i\fs24 I will be your strength when you have no strength of your own.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Knowing he was doomed, Cholik turned and glanced back up the bone bridge. The silver star glowed brighter, revealing more of the path. The bridge of bones continued to lead up, but it zigzagged back and forth. What seemed to be trees occupied the elbows of the zigzags.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik hesitated, trying to muster more strength but knowing that his body had none left to give.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Come, Buyard Cholik,\plain \f2\fs24 the demon taunted.\plain \f2\i\fs24 You made your choice when you stepped through that doorway. You only had the illusion of being able to change your mind along the way.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik felt as though a great hand squeezed his chest, squeezing the breath from him. Was it his heart, then? Was it finally going to fail him? Or was this Zakarum\'92s vengeance for abandoning the church?
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Of course,\plain \f2\fs24 Kabraxis said,\plain \f2\i\fs24 you could throw yourself from the bridge.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik was tempted, but only for a moment. The temptation came not out of fear but out of rebellion. But that{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint107}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint107}was just a momentary spark. The fear in him of death was a raging bonfire. He lifted a foot and went on.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  As he neared the first of the trees, he saw that they bore fruit. When he was closer, he saw the fruits on the tree were tiny human heads. The small faces were filled with fear. Their lips moved in pleading that only then became audible to him. Although he couldn\'92t understand their words, Cholik understood their agony. The sound was an undercurrent, a rush of pain and despair that was somehow horribly melodic.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Tormented voices,\plain \f2\fs24 Kabraxis said.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Isn\'92t it the sweetest sound you\'92ve ever heard?
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik kept walking, finding another bend and another tree and another chorus of hopelessness and hurt. His breath burned inside his chest and he felt as if iron bands constricted his chest.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He faltered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Come, Buyard Cholik. It\'92s only a little farther. Would you die there and become one of the fruits on the tree?
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Pain blurred the old priest\'92s vision, but he lifted his head after the next turn and saw that the bridge remained straight to a small island that floated in the middle of the darkness. The silver star hung behind the shoulder of a massive humanoid shape sitting on a stone throne.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Gasping, no longer able to do more than sip air, knowing he was only inches from death, Cholik made the final ascent and stopped in front of the massive figure on the throne. Unable to stand in front of the demon, the old priest dropped to his hands and knees on the abrasive black rock that made up the island. He coughed, weakly; the coppery taste of blood filled his mouth, and he saw the scarlet threads spray onto the black rock.

The demon\'92s massively broad body was black flesh, marbled with blue fire that burned and ran through him. His face was horrid, crafted of hard planes and rudimentary features: two inverted triangle eyes, no nose but black pits that were nostrils, and a lipless gash of a mouth filled with yellowed fangs. Writhing, poisonous vipers sprouted from his head, all of them beautiful, cool crystal colors of a rainbow.

Dead pirates sprawled across the steps as well, victims of the Westmarch Navy rescue crew who had taken the boy from him. Other pirates had fallen into the river and been swept away.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lhex rolled his eyes at Darrick, showing obvious disapproval. \'93I was sent to Lut Gholein to be priest-trained. I\'92ve spent four years in school there. Some of our main philosophy books deal with the thematic struggle between man{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint113}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint113}and his demons. They aren\'92t supposed to be real.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The wind came down out of the peaks of Hawk\'92s Beak Mountains and chilled Darrick. Sweat from his exertions matted his hair, but it lifted as he gazed at the ruins of the city. Pirates boiled along the top of the cliff overhanging the Dyre River, their lanterns and torches cutting through the stirring fog and reflecting in the river below.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 the boy said earnestly, \'93but demons steal the souls of honest men. And Kabraxis was one of the worst while he walked through these lands.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Ye ain\'92t gettin\'92 me to believe in demons,\'94 Tomas said, his face dark with suspicion. \'93Stories, that\'92s all them legends are. Just meant to give a man a laugh an\'92 maybe a sense of unease now an\'92 again.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick nodded to the carnage left of the city. \'93If Kabraxis is responsible for that, I\'92d say the pirates and the priests aren\'92t going to find him any too thankful to be woke up.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The wind ruffled the boy\'92s hair, and lightning seared the sky, painting his features the pale color of bone. \'93Diablo and his brothers feared Kabraxis.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick already knew that. He took a deep breath, smelling the approaching storm on the wind, and hardened his voice. \'93Better I should leave you here and tell the king I didn\'92t get to you in time.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The boy\'92s dark eyes regarded Darrick for only a moment. \'93You won\'92t do that. You can\'92t.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick scowled fiercely, hoping to scare the boy.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And if you take me back without checking on the demon,\'94 Lhex threatened, \'93I\'92ll tell the king that you had the chance to find out more and you didn\'92t. After the troubles in Tristram, I don\'92t think my uncle will take kindly to a sailor derelict in his duty to find out as much as he could.\'94 The boy raised his eyebrows. \'93Do you?\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick held his tongue for a moment, willing the boy to back down. But even if Lhex did, Darrick knew the truth of the boy\'92s words would weigh on him.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Darrick said. \'93I don\'92t think the king would take kindly to such a sailor at all.\'94 He raised his voice. \'93Maldrin.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I can do that,\'94 Maldrin said grudgingly. \'93If it comes to it, I\'92ll tie him up an\'92 lower him by a rope down the mountainside.\'94 He glared at the boy for a moment, then turned his attention back to Darrick. \'93I don\'92t know that I agree that ye a-harin\'92 off right this minute is all that bright.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ve never been overly accused of brightness,\'94 Darrick said, but it was only bravado that he didn\'92t feel.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I ain\'92t gonna be left behind,\'94 Mat said, shaking his head. \'93No, if it\'92s to be demon huntin\'92 in the offin\'92, ye got to count me in, Darrick.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick looked at his oldest and best friend in the world. \'93Aye. I will, and glad to have you, but we\'92re not about to have a good time of it.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat smiled. \'93It\'92ll be an adventure we can tell our grandkids about whilst we dandle \'92em on our knees in our dotage, me an\'92 ye.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I should go with you,\'94 Lhex interrupted.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick looked at the boy. \'93No. You\'92ve pushed this as far as needs be. You leave the matter with us now. The king wouldn\'92t be happy to hear that his nephew wasn\'92t amenable to being rescued by men who laid down their lives for him, either. Understand?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Reluctantly, the boy nodded.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Now, you did yourself a good turn back on the pirate ship by getting yourself free,\'94 Darrick said. \'93I expect the same behavior while you\'92re with these men I\'92m asking to guard you with their lives. Have we got a bargain?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93But I can identify the demon\'97\'94 the boy said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Boy,\'94 Darrick said, \'93I believe I\'92ll know a demon should I see one.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The coming storm continued to gather strength as Darrick led the group of sailors back into the ruins of the city. The moon disappeared often behind the dark, threatening{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint116}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint116}masses of storm clouds, leaving the world cluttered with black silk, then appeared again to draw harsh, long shadows against the silvered grounds. The alabaster columns and stones of the city blazed with an inner fire whenever moonlight touched them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sailors moved in silence, unencumbered by armor the way militiamen would be. The king\'92s army corps seldom went anywhere without the rattle and clangor of chainmail or plate. Those things were death to a man fighting on a ship if he somehow ended up in the water.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Finding the entrance to the underground cavern in the ruins turned out to be easy. Darrick held his group back, then followed the last of Raithen\'92s pirates down into the cleared path that led into the bowels of the earth beneath the remains of Tauruk\'92s Port.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  None of them spoke over the droning buzz that filled the cavern farther down. The dank earth blocked the wind, but it kept the wintry chill locked around Darrick. The cold made his body ache worse. The long climb up the cliff as well as the battles he\'92d fought had stripped him of energy, leaving him running on sheer adrenaline. He looked forward to his hammock aboard\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star\plain \f2\fs24 and the few days\'92 journey it would take to reach Westmarch.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Fog or a dusty haze filled the cavern. The haze looked golden in the dim light of the lanterns Raithen\'92s pirates carried.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Gradually, the tunnel Darrick followed widened, and he saw the great door set into the stone wall on the other side of the immense cavern. The tunnel went no farther.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen and his pirates stopped before entering the main cavern area, and their position blocked Darrick\'92s view of what lay ahead. Several of the pirates seemed in favor of turning and fleeing, but Raithen held them firm with his harsh voice and the threat of his sword.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hunkering down behind a slab of rock that had slid free during the excavation, Darrick stared into the cavern. Mat joined him, his breath rasping softly.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What\'92s wrong?\'94 Darrick whispered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint117}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint117}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It\'92s this damn dust,\'94 Mat whispered back. \'93Must not have settled from the explosion earlier. It\'92s tightenin\'92 me lungs up a mite.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taking the sleeve of his torn shirt in one hand, Darrick ripped it off and handed it to Mat. \'93Tie this around your face,\'94 he told his friend. \'93It\'92ll keep the dust out.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat accepted the garment remnant gratefully and tied it around his face.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick tore the other sleeve off and tied it around his own face. It was a pity because the shirt had been a favorite of his, though it was no comparison to the Kurastian silk shirts he had in his sea chest aboard\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star.\plain \f2\fs24 Still, growing up hard and without as he had, he treasured things and generally took good care of the ones he had.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Slowly and tentatively, Raithen led his pirates down into the cavern.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Darrick, look!\'94 Mat pointed, indicating the skeletons that lay in the cavern area. A few looked old, but most of them appeared to have been just stripped clean. Ragged clothing, torn but not aged, swaddled the skeletons.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I see them,\'94 Darrick said, and the hair at the back of his neck lifted. He wasn\'92t one for magic, and he knew he was looking at sure proof that magic had been recently worked.\plain \f2\i\fs24 We shouldn\'92t be here,\plain \f2\fs24 he told himself.\plain \f2\i\fs24 If I had any sense, I\'92d leave now before any of us are hurt.\plain \f2\fs24 In fact, he was just about to give the order when a man in black and scarlet robes stepped through the immense doorway in the far wall.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The man in scarlet and black looked as if he was in his early forties. His black hair held gray at the temples, and his face was lean and strong. A shimmering aura flowed around him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Captain Raithen,\'94 the man in scarlet and black greeted, but his words held little warmth.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The droning buzz increased in intensity.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Cholik,\'94 Raithen said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Why aren\'92t you with the ships?\'94 Cholik asked. He{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint118}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint118}crossed the cavern floor, oblivious to the carnage of freshly dead men scattered around him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We were attacked,\'94 Raithen said. \'93Westmarch sailors set fire to my ships and stole the boy we held for ransom.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You were followed?\'94 Cholik\'92s anger cut through the droning noise that filled the cavern.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Who is that man?\'94 Mat whispered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick shook his head. \'93I don\'92t know. And I don\'92t see a demon around here, either. Let\'92s go. It\'92s not going to take that Cholik guy long to figure out what Raithen and his pirates are doing here.\'94 He turned and signaled to the other men, getting them ready to withdraw.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Maybe it wasn\'92t me who got followed,\'94 Raithen argued. \'93Maybe one of those men you buy information from in Westmarch got caught doing something and sold you out.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Cholik said. He stopped out of sword\'92s reach from the pirate captain. \'93The people who do business with me would be afraid to do something like that. If your ships were attacked, it was through your own gross ineptitude.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Maybe we should just skip all this faultfinding,\'94 Raithen suggested.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And then what should we do, captain?\'94 Cholik regarded the pirate captain with contempt and cold amusement. \'93Get to the part where you and your murderous crew kill me and try to take whatever it is that you\'92ve imagined I\'92ve found here?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen grinned without humor. \'93Not a very pretty way to put it, but that\'92s about it.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik drew his robes in with imperious grace. \'93No. That won\'92t be done this night.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Striding forward, Raithen said, \'93I don\'92t know what kind of night you had planned for yourself, Cholik, but I aim to get what I came for. My men and I have spent blood for you, and the way we figure it, we haven\'92t gotten much in return.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Your greed is going to get you killed,\'94 Cholik threatened.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A massive shape stepped through the door in the stone wall. Darrick stared at the demon, taking in the writhing snake hair, the barbaric features, the huge three-fingered hands, and the black skin slashed through with pale blue.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Raithen and his pirates drew back from the demon, filled with fear as the nightmare from the Burning Hells strode into the cavern. Men yelled in terror and retreated quickly.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \'93Okay,\'94 Mat whispered, fear shining in his eyes, \'93we can tell the boy an\'92 his uncle the king that the demon exists. Let\'92s be away from here.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Wait,\'94 Darrick said, mastering the thrumming fear that filled him at the sight of the demon. He peered over the stone slab they hid behind.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93For what?\'94 Mat gave him a disbelieving look. He made the sign of the Light in the air before him unconsciously, like the child he\'92d been when they\'92d attended church in Hillsfar.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Do you know how many men have seen a demon?\'94 Darrick asked.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93An\'92 them livin\'92 to tell about it? Damned few. An\'92 ye want to know why, Darrick? \'92Cause they were killed by the demons they was gawkin\'92 at instead of runnin\'92 as any sane man should do.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Captain Raithen,\'94 the demon said, and his voice rolled like thunder inside the cavern. \'93I am Kabraxis, called the Enlightener. There is no need for disharmony between yourself and Buyard Cholik. You can continue to work together.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93For you?\'94 Raithen asked. His voice held fear and awe, but he stood before the demon with his sword in his fist.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 the demon replied. \'93Through me, you can find the true path to your future.\'94 He strode forward, stepping in front of the priest. \'93I can help you. I can bring you peace.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick thought the reply would have sounded better if the pirate captain\'92s voice hadn\'92t been shaking, but he didn\'92t doubt that he would have had trouble controlling his own voice if he\'92d spoken to the demon.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Then you can die,\'94 Kabraxis said, waving a hand in an intricate pattern before him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Archers!\'94 Raithen yelled. \'93Feather that hell-spawned beast!\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The pirates were stunned by the presence of the demon and slow to react. Only a few of them nocked and released arrows. The dozen or so arrows that hit the demon glanced off, leaving no sign that they had ever touched him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Darrick,\'94 Mat pleaded desperately, \'93the others have already gone.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Glancing over his shoulder, Darrick saw that it was true. The other sailors who had accompanied them were already beating a hasty retreat.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat pulled at Darrick\'92s shoulder. \'93C\'92mon. There\'92s naught we can do here. Gettin\'92 ourselves safe an\'92 to home, that\'92s our job now.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick nodded, getting up from behind the stone slab just as waves of shimmering force shot out from the demon\'92s hand.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kabraxis spoke words Darrick felt certain no human tongue could master. The droning inside the cavern increased, and what looked at first like fireflies dropped from the stalactites above. Flashing through the torchlit cavern, the fireflies slammed into Raithen\'92s pirates but stayed clear of the pirate captain.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Frozen with horror, Darrick watched as the insects reduced the pirates they struck to stacks of bloody bones. No sooner did the freshly flensed corpses strike the stony ground than they lurched back to their feet and took up arms against the few pirates who had survived the initial assault.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sound of men screaming, cursing, and dying filled the cavern.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint122}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint122}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kabraxis walked toward the survivors. \'93If you would live, my children, come to me. Give yourselves to me. I can make you whole again. I can teach you to dream and be more than you ever thought you could be. Come to me.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A handful of pirates rushed to the demon and supplicated themselves before Kabraxis. Gently, the demon touched their foreheads, leaving a bloody mark tattooed into their flesh, but they were saved from the insects and the skeletons.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Even Raithen went forward.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The light in the cavern dimmed as the men abandoned or lost their lanterns and torches. Darrick struggled to see clearly.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen kept his sword at hand as he walked toward the demon. There was no way out of the cavern. Skeletons of his men blocked the path back to the tunnel. And even if he got past them, there were the carnivorous insects to deal with.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But Raithen wasn\'92t a man to surrender. As soon as he was close enough, one hand extended in obeisance for the demon to take, he struck with the sword, plunging it deep into the demon\'92s abdomen. Jewels gleamed in the hilt and the blade, and Darrick knew the sword possessed some magic. He thought just for a moment that it was a lucky thing he\'92d not crossed blades with the man aboard\plain \f2\i\fs24 Barracuda.\plain \f2\fs24 Even a small wound from an enchanted weapon could wreak havoc with a man if the blade held poison.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen\'92s blade held fire. As soon as the sword plunged into the demon\'92s body, flames lashed out from the wound, scorching the flesh.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kabraxis howled in pain and staggered back, clutching at the wound in his stomach. Not to be denied, Raithen stepped after the creature, twisting his sword cruelly to open the demon\'92s stomach farther.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You\'92ll die, demon,\'94 Raithen snarled, but Darrick heard the panic in the man\'92s voice. Perhaps the pirate captain thought he\'92d had no choice but to attack, but once committed, he had no choice but to continue.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint123}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint123}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Demons died on men\'92s blades and by spells learned by human mages, Darrick knew, but demons could be reborn, and it took a hell of a lot to kill them. Most of the time, humans only succeeded in banishing demons from the human planes for a time, and even centuries were nothing to the demons. They always returned to prey on men again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen attacked again, plunging his sword deep into the demon\'92s stomach. Fire belched forth again, but Kabraxis showed only signs of discomfort, not distress. Flinging out one giant hand, the demon wrapped all three fingers around Raithen\'92s head before he could escape.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kabraxis spoke again, and an inferno whirled to life in his hand fitted over Raithen\'92s head and shoulders. The pirate captain never managed to scream as his body went stiff. When the demon released the pirate captain, flames had consumed Raithen\'92s upper body, leaving a charred and blackened husk where a powerfully built man had once stood. Orange coals still gleamed in Raithen\'92s body, and smoke rose from the smoldering burns. The pirate captain\'92s mouth was open in a silent scream that would never be heard.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Darrick,\'94 Mat whispered hoarsely, tugging on his friend\'92s arm again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Bone rasped against rock behind Darrick, alerting him to other dangers waiting in the shadows around him. He glanced up, spotting the skeleton behind Mat that lifted its short sword and aimed at Mat\'92s back.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick fisted Mat\'92s shirt with one hand as he stood and lifted his cutlass. Yanking Mat from the skeleton, Darrick parried the short sword then snap-kicked the skeleton\'92s skull. The undead thing\'92s lower jaw tore loose, and broken teeth flew in all directions. The skeleton staggered back and tried to lift the sword again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat swung his sword at the skeleton. The heavy blade caught the skeleton\'92s neck and snapped the skull off.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Get those men,\'94 the demon roared farther down in the main cavern.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint124}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint124}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Go,\'94 Darrick yelled, pushing Mat before him. They ran together, avoiding the slow-moving skeletons that had been roused by the demon\'92s unholy magic. Darrick had fought skeletons before, and a man could usually outrun one if he outpaced them. However, if a pack of skeletons came upon a man, they wore him down in numbers, taking hellish beatings before they were finally too damaged to continue.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The droning buzz of the insects filled the cavern behind them, then the tunnel as they zipped into that. Other skeletons rose before Darrick and Mat as they ran through the tunnels beneath the dead city. Some of the skeletons had drying blood covering the white ivory of bone, but others wore tatters of clothing that had gone out of fashion a hundred years ago. Tauruk\'92s Port had been home to innumerable dead, and they were all coming back at the demon\'92s call.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick ran, driving his feet hard, breath whistling against the back of his throat, ignoring the pain and fatigue that filled him, fueling himself with the primordial fear that thrilled through him. \'93Run!\'94 he yelled to Mat. \'93Run, damn it, or they\'92ll take you!\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Don\'92t look back,\'94 Darrick ordered. \'93Keep your eyes facing front. If you trip, you\'92ll never get back up again in time.\'94 Still, he couldn\'92t resist ignoring his own advice and looking over his shoulder.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The skeletons pounded after them, weapons upraised to attack. Their bony feet slapped the stone floor with hollow clacks. As Darrick watched, toes snapped off the skeletons\'92 feet, bouncing crazily through the tunnel. But the insects buzzed by them, the drone growing louder in Darrick\'92s ears.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  They easily avoided most of the skeletons that stepped out of the shadows in front of them. The undead creatures were slow, and there was room enough, but a few of them had to be physically countered. Darrick used his sword, unable to utilize the weapon with much skill while running at full tilt, but it allowed him to turn aside swords and spears the skeletons wielded. But each contact cost him precious inches that were damned hard to replace.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  How far is it to the river?\plain \f2\fs24 Darrick tried to remember and couldn\'92t. Now, it suddenly seemed like forever.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The buzzing grew louder, thunderous.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93They\'92re goin\'92 to get us,\'94 Mat said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Darrick said, forcing the words out and knowing he couldn\'92t spare the breath it took. \'93No, damn it. I didn\'92t bring you here to die, Mat. You keep running.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Suddenly, the mouth of the tunnel was before them, around a turn that Darrick had thought would be their last. Jagged streaks of white-hot lightning seared the sky and clawed away long strips of night for a moment. Hope spurred them both on. He saw it in Mat\'92s face and took heart in it himself. Fewer skeletons darted out of the shadows at them now.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Just a little farther,\'94 Darrick said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93An\'92 then that long run to the river, ye mean.\'94 Mat gasped for breath. He was always the better runner of them, always more agile and quick, almost as at home as Caron in the ship\'92s rigging.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick wondered if his friend was holding back, not running at full speed. The thought angered him. Mat should have left with the other sailors, who were long gone from the tunnels.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Miraculously, they reached the final incline to the mouth of the tunnel leading into the ruins of Tauruk\'92s Port. The carnivorous insects stayed so close now that Darrick saw their pale green coloring out of the corner of his eye as he ran.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Outside the tunnel\'92s mouth, as he emerged into a sudden squall of wind and rain, a stray piece of stone slithered{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint126}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint126}out from under Mat\'92s foot. With a startled yelp, he fell sliding and flailing through the clutter and debris that had tumbled from the ruins.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Mat!\'94 Darrick watched in horror, stopping his own headlong pace with difficulty. The rain was almost blinding, stinging his face and arms. The storm wasn\'92t a normal one, and he wondered how much the demon\'92s arrival in the cavern below had affected the weather. The ground had already turned mushy underfoot from all the rain in the last several minutes.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Don\'92t ye stop!\'94 Mat yelled, trying desperately to get up. He spat rainwater from his mouth, the sleeve Darrick had given him to mask out the dust below hanging around his neck. \'93Don\'92t ye dare stop on account of me, Darrick Lang! I\'92ll not have your death on me head!\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And I\'92m not about to let you die alone,\'94 Darrick replied, coming to a halt and taking a two-handed grip on the cutlass. The rain cascaded down his body. He was already drenched. The cold water ran into his mouth, carrying a rancid taste he\'92d never experienced before. Or maybe it was his own fear he tasted.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then the insects were on them. Mat was to his feet but could only start to run as the cloud of insects closed in for the kill.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick swiped at the insects with his sword, knowing it was ineffectual. The keen blade sliced through two of the fat-bodied demonic bugs, leaving smears of green blood across the steel that washed away almost immediately in the pouring rain. In the next instant, the insects vanished in liquid pops of emerald fire that left a sulfuric stench behind.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Staring, Darrick watched as the rest of the insects lost their corporeal existence in the same fashion. They continued flying at him, the haze of green flames getting so thick it became a wall of color.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Those foul creatures, they have trouble existin\'92 on this plane,\'94 Mat said in awe.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick didn\'92t know. Of the two of them, Mat had more{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint127}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint127}use for the stories of mages and legendary things. But the insects continued their assault, dying by the droves only inches from their intended victims. The cloud thinned out, and the color died down in the space of a drawn breath.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  That was when Darrick saw the first of the skeletons race through the tunnel mouth, war ax uplifted. Darrick dodged the ax blow and kicked out, tripping the skeleton. The skeleton fell and slid across the mounds of muddy debris like a stone skipping across a pond, then smashed against the side of a building.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Go!\'94 Darrick yelled, grabbing Mat and getting him started again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  They ran, sprinting toward the river again. And the skeletons poured after them, soundless as ghosts except for the thud of feet against the rain-drenched land.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Having no reason to hide anymore, certain that any pirates who might remain between them and the river wouldn\'92t stick around long enough to engage them, Darrick fled through the center of the disheveled city. The ragged lightning that tore at the purple sky made the terrain uncertain and tricky. But the thing that got them in the end was that they were human and fatigued. Darrick and Mat slowed, their hearts and lungs and legs no longer able to keep up with the demand. The inexorable rush of the skeletons did not waver, did not slow.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick glanced over his shoulder and saw only death behind them. Black spots swam in his vision, and every drawn breath felt empty of air, as if it was all motion and nothing of substance. The rain-filled wind made it hard to breathe and slashed at his face.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat slowed, and they were only a hundred yards or less from the river\'92s edge. If they could make the edge, Darrick thought, and throw themselves into the water\'97somehow survive the plunge without smashing up against the stone bottom of the riverbed\'97perhaps they had a chance. The river was deep, and skeletons couldn\'92t swim because they had no flesh to help them remain buoyant.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick ran, throwing down his cutlass, only then recognizing{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint128}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint128}that it was dead weight and was slowing him. Survival didn\'92t lie in fighting; it lay in flight. He ran another ten yards, somehow stretched into another twenty, and kept lifting his knees, driving his numbed feet against the ground even though he didn\'92t trust his footing.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  And then, all at once it seemed, they were at the edge. Mat was at his side, face pale from being winded and hurting for far too long. Then, just when Darrick felt certain he could almost throw himself into the air and trust his momentum to carry him over the edge and into the Dyre River beyond, something grabbed his foot. He fell. Senses swimming already, he nearly blacked out from his chin\'92s impact against the ground.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Get up, Darrick!\'94 Mat yelled, grabbing his arm.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Instinctively, driven by fear, Darrick kicked out, freeing himself from the skeleton that had leapt at him and caught up his foot. The rest of them came on, tightly together like a rat pack.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat dragged Darrick to the edge, only just avoiding the outstretched hands and fingers of the skeletons. Without pause, Mat flung Darrick over the edge, then readied himself to jump.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick saw all of that as he began the long fall to the whitecapped river so far below. And he saw the skeleton that leapt and caught Mat before he could get clear of the cliff.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No!\'94 Darrick shouted, instinctively reaching for Mat although he knew he was too far away to do anything.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But the skeleton\'92s rush succeeded in knocking Mat over the cliff. They fell, embraced in death, and bounced from the cliffside no more than ten feet from the river\'92s surface.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Bone crunched, and the sound reached Darrick\'92s ears just before he plunged into the icy river. In just moments since the storm had started, the river current had picked up. What had once been a steady flow out toward the Gulf of Westmarch now became a torrent. He kicked out, his arms and legs feeling like lead, certain that he\'92d never{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint129}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint129}break the river\'92s surface before he filled his lungs with water.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lightning flashed across the sky, bringing the sky sandwiched between the cliffsides out in bold relief for a moment. The intensity was almost blinding.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Mat!\plain \f2\fs24 Darrick looked around in the water, trying desperately to find his friend. His lungs burned as he swam, pushing himself toward the surface. Then he was through, his vision wavering, and he sucked in a great draught of air.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The river\'92s surface was lathered with whitecaps that washed over him. The fog was thicker now, swirling through the canyon between the mountains. Darrick shook the water from his eyes, searching frantically for Mat. The skeleton had gone in with Mat. Had it dragged him down?
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Thunder split the night. A moment later, projectiles started plummeting into the river. Tracking the movement, Darrick saw the skeletons hurling themselves from the cliffside. They smashed into the water nearly thirty feet upriver from him, and that was when he realized how much he had moved since he\'92d entered the water.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He watched the surface for a moment, wondering if the skeletons had been given an ability to swim. He\'92d never heard of such a thing, but he\'92d never seen a demon before tonight, either.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Mat!
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Something bumped against Darrick\'92s leg. His immediate gut reaction was to push back from it and get away. Then one of Mat\'92s arms floated through the water by him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Mat!\'94 Darrick yelled, grabbing for the arm and pulling the other man up. Lightning seared the sky again as he held Mat\'92s back against his chest and fought to keep both their heads above water. The waves slapped him constantly in the face. A moment later, a skeleton\'92s head popped up in the river, letting Darrick know it still had hold of Mat\'92s leg.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick kicked at the undead thing as the river current caught them more securely in its grasp. The cliffsides holding{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint130}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint130}the river on course swept by at greater speed and Mat\'92s weight combined with the weight of the skeleton was enough to keep Darrick under most of the time. He only came up behind Mat\'92s back for a quick gulp or two of air, then submerged again to keep up the fight to keep Mat\'92s head out of the water.\plain \f2\i\fs24 By the Light, please give me the strength to do this!
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Twice, as the current roiled and changed, Mat was nearly torn from Darrick\'92s grip. The water was cold enough to numb his hands, and the exhaustion he felt turned him weak.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Mat!\'94 he screamed in his friend\'92s ear, then went down again. He managed to call out to Mat twice more as they raced down the river but didn\'92t get any reaction. Mat remained dead weight in his arms.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lightning strobed the sky again, and this time Darrick thought he spotted blood on his elbow. It wasn\'92t his blood, and he knew it had to have come from Mat. But when the next wave hit him and he resurfaced, the blood wasn\'92t there, and he couldn\'92t be sure if it ever was.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Darrick!\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Maldrin\'92s voice came out of the night without warning.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick tried to turn his head, but the effort sent him plunging below the waterline again. He kicked the water fiercely, keeping Mat elevated. When he rose again, thunder boomed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93\'97rick!\'94 Maldrin squalled again in his huge voice that could reach the top of the rigging or empty a tavern of sailors that crewed aboard\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Here!\'94 Darrick yelled, spluttering, spitting water. \'93Here, Maldrin!\'94 He sank, then fought his way up again. Each time was getting harder. The skeleton remained clinging to Mat\'92s leg, and twice Darrick had to kick free of its embrace. \'93Hang on, Mat. Please hang on. It\'92s only a little longer now. Maldrin\'92s\'97\'94 The current took him down again, and this time he spotted light from a lantern on his port side.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93\'97see them!\'94 Maldrin roared. \'93Hold this damn boat, lads!\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint131}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint131}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick came up again, seeing a thick black shadow rising up from behind him, then lightning split the sky and reflected from the dark water, illuminating Maldrin\'92s homely features for a moment.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I got ye, skipper!\'94 Maldrin yelled above the storm. \'93I got ye. Just ye come back on ahead to ol\'92 Maldrin, an\'92 let me take some of that weight from ye.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  For a moment, Darrick feared that the mate was going to miss him. Then he felt Maldrin take hold of his hair\'97the easiest part of a drowning victim to grab hold of\'97and would have screamed with agony if he hadn\'92t been choking on water. Then, incredibly, Maldrin pulled him back toward the longboat they\'92d arrived in.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Give a hand!\'94 Maldrin yelled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Tomas reached down and hooked his hands under Mat\'92s arms, then leaned back and started pulling him into the longboat. \'93I\'92ve got him, Darrick. Let him go.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Freed from Mat\'92s weight, Darrick\'92s arms slid away limply. If it hadn\'92t been for Maldrin holding him, he was sure he would have been swept away by the current. He fought to help Maldrin pull him on board, catching a glimpse of the boy, Lhex, wrapped in a blanket that was already soaked through from the rain.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We waited for ye, skipper,\'94 Maldrin said as he pulled. \'93Held steady to our course \'92cause we knew ye\'92d be here. Hadn\'92t ever been a time ye didn\'92t make it, no matter how bollixed up things looked like they was a-gettin\'92.\'94 He slapped Darrick on the shoulder. \'93An\'92 ye done us proud again.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Something\'92s holdin\'92 him,\'94 Tomas said, fighting to bring Mat onto the longboat.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Skeleton,\'94 Darrick said. \'93It\'92s holding on to his leg.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Without warning, the undead thing erupted from the water, lunging at Tomas with an open mouth like a hungry wolf. Galvanized by his fear, Tomas yanked back, pulling Mat into the longboat with him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Calmly, as if he were reaching for a dish at a tavern, Maldrin picked up his war hammer and smashed the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint132}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint132}skeleton\'92s skull. Going limp, the undead creature released its hold and disappeared into the whitecapped water.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick\'92s chest heaved as he sucked in huge lungfuls of air. \'93River\'92s full of skeletons. They followed us in. They can\'92t swim, but they\'92re in the water. If they find the boat anchor\'97\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The longboat suddenly shuddered and swung sideways, no longer pointed into the current so that it could ride out the gorged river easier. It bucked like a mustang, throwing all the sailors aboard it around as if they were ragdolls.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Something\'92s got hold of the rope!\'94 one of the sailors yelled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Shoving the other sailors aside, Maldrin raked a knife from his boot and sawed through the anchor rope as skeletal hands grabbed the longboat\'92s gunwales. The boat leapt into the river, cutting across the whitecaps like a thing possessed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Man those oars!\'94 Maldrin bawled, grabbing one from the middle of the longboat himself. \'93Get this damn boat squared away afore we all go down with it!\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Struggling against the exhaustion that filled him as well as the longboat being tossed like a child\'92s toy on the rushing river, Darrick pushed himself up and crawled over to Mat Hu-Ring. \'93Mat!\'94 he called.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lightning flashed, and thunder filled the river canyon through the Hawk\'92s Beak Mountains.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Mat.\'94 Tenderly, Darrick rolled Mat\'92s head over, sickened at once by how lax and loose it was on his neck.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat\'92s face kept rolling, coming around to face Darrick.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Darrick lay in his hammock aboard\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star,\plain \f2\fs24 his hands folded behind his head, and tried not to think of the dreams that had plagued him the last two nights. In those dreams, Mat was still alive, but Darrick still lived with his parents in the butcher\'92s shop in Hillsfar. Since he had left, Darrick had never gone back.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Over the years since his departure from the town, Mat had gone back to visit with his family on special occasions, arriving there by merchant ship and signing on as a cargo guard while on leave from the Westmarch Navy. Darrick had always suspected that Mat hadn\'92t visited his home or his family as much as he had wanted to. But Mat had believed there would be plenty of time. That was Mat\'92s nature: he never hurried about anything, took each thing in its time and place.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Now, Mat would never go home again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick seized the pain that filled him before it could escape his control. That control was rock-solid. He\'92d built it carefully, through beating after beating, through bald cruel things his father had said, till that control was just as strong and as sure as a blacksmith\'92s anvil.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He shifted his head, feeling the ache in his back, neck, and shoulders from all the climbing he\'92d done the night before last. Turning his head, he gazed out the porthole at the glittering blue-green water of the Gulf of Westmarch. Judging from the way the light hit the ocean, it was noon\'97almost time.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lying in the hammock, sipping his breaths, stilling himself and controlling the pain that threatened to overflow{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint136}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint136}even the boundaries he\'92d put up, he waited. He tried counting his heartbeats, feeling them echo in his head, but waiting was hard when he measured the time. It was better to go numb and let nothing touch him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then the deck pipe played, blasting shrill and somehow sweet over the constant wave splash of the ocean, calling the ship\'92s crew together.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick closed his eyes and worked on imagining nothing, remembering nothing. But the sour scent of the moldy hay in the loft above the pens where his father kept the animals waiting to be slain and bled out filled his nose. Before Darrick knew it, a brief glimpse of Mat Hu-Ring, nine years old in clothing that was too big for him, flipped down from the rooftop and landed inside the loft. Mat had climbed the chimney of the smokehouse attached to the barn behind the butcher\'92s shop and made his way across the roof until he was able to enter the loft.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  In his shame, his body covered with bruises, Darrick had tried to act mad at Mat and make him go away. But it was hard to be convincing when he had to be so quiet. Getting loud enough to attract his father\'92s attention\'97and let his father know someone else was aware of his punishment\'97was out of the question. After Mat had spread the apples and cheese out, adding a wilted flower to make it more of a feast and a joke, Darrick hadn\'92t been able to keep up the pretense, and even embarrassment hadn\'92t curbed his hunger.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  If his father had ever once found out about Mat\'92s visits during those times, Darrick knew he would never have seen Mat again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick opened his eyes and stared up at the unmarked ceiling. Just as he would never see him again now. Darrick reached for the cold numbness that he used to cover himself when things became too much. It slipped on like armor, each piece fitting the others perfectly. No weakness remained within him.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Then I\'92ll expect you to clean yourself up properly,\'94 Captain Tollifer said, \'93and get yourself topside in relatively short order.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye, sir.\'94 Even with all his respect for the captain and fear of his position, Darrick barely restrained the scathing rebuttal that came to mind. His grief for Mat was his own, not property of the Westmarch Navy.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The captain turned to go, then stopped at the door and spoke, looking at Darrick earnestly. \'93I\'92ve lost friends before, Mr. Lang. It\'92s never easy. We perform the funerals so that we may begin letting go in a proper fashion. It isn\'92t to forget them but only to remind ourselves that some closure is given in death and to help us mark an eternal place for them in our hearts. A few good men are born into this world who should never be forgotten. Mr. Hu-Ring was one of those, and I feel privileged to have served with him and known him. I won\'92t be saying that in the address topside because you know I stand on policy and procedure aboard my ship, but I wanted you to know that.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Thank you, sir,\'94 Darrick said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The captain placed his hat on his head. \'93I\'92ll give you a reasonable amount of time to get ready, Mr. Lang. Please be prompt.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye, sir.\'94 Darrick watched the captain go, feeling the pain boiling over inside him, turning to anger that drew to it like a lodestone all the old rage he\'92d kept bottled up for so long. He closed his eyes, trembling, then released his pent-up breath and sealed the emotions away.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  When he opened his eyes, he told himself he felt nothing.{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint139}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint139}He was an automaton. If he felt nothing, he couldn\'92t be hurt. His father had taught him that.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mechanically, ignoring even the aches and pains that filled him from that night, Darrick went to the foot of his hammock and opened his sea chest. Since the night at Tauruk\'92s Port, he hadn\'92t been returned to active duty. None of the crew had except Maldrin, who couldn\'92t be expected to lie abed on a ship when there was so much to do.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick chose a clean uniform, shaved quickly with the straight razor without nicking himself too badly, and dressed. There were three other junior officers aboard\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star;\plain \f2\fs24 he was senior among them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Striding out on deck, pulling on the white gloves that were demanded at ceremonial occasions, Darrick looked past the faces of the men as they stared at him. He was neutral, untouchable. They would see nothing on him today because there was nothing to see. He returned their crisp salutes proficiently.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The noonday sun hung high above\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star.\plain \f2\fs24 Light struck the sea, glittering in the blue-green troughs between the white rollers like a spray of gemstones. The rigging and canvas sheets above creaked and snapped in the wind as the ship plunged toward Westmarch, carrying the news of the pirate chieftain\'92s death as well as the unbelievable return of a demon to the world of man. The men aboard\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star\plain \f2\fs24 had talked of little else since the rescue crew\'92s return to the ship, and Darrick knew all of Westmarch would soon be buzzing with the news as well. The impossible had happened.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick took his place beside the three other junior officers at the forefront of the sailors. All three of the officers were much younger than he, one of them still in his teens and already knowing command because his father had purchased a commission for him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A momentary flicker of resentment touched Darrick\'92s heart as they stood beside Mat\'92s flag-covered body on the plank balanced on the starboard railing. None of the other{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint140}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint140}officers deserved those positions; they had not been true sailing men like Mat. Darrick had chosen to follow his own career and become an officer when offered, but Mat never had. Captain Tollifer had never seen fit to extend a commission to Mat, though Darrick had never understood why. As a rule, such a promotion wasn\'92t done much, and hardly ever was it done aboard the same ship. But Captain Tollifer had done just such a thing.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The officers standing beside Darrick had never known a bosun\'92s lash for failing to carry out a captain\'92s orders or for failing to carry them out to their full extent. Darrick had, and he\'92d borne those injuries and insults with the same stoic resolve his father had trained him to have. Darrick hadn\'92t been afraid to take command in the field even when under orders. In the beginning, such behavior had earned him floggings under hard captains who refused to acknowledge his reinterpretation of their commands, but under Captain Tollifer, Darrick had come into his own.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Mat had never been interested in becoming an officer. He\'92d enjoyed the hard life of a sailor.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  During their years aboard the ships of the Westmarch Navy, Darrick had often thought that he had been taking care of Mat, looking out for his friend. But looking at the sheet-draped body in front of him, Darrick knew that Mat had never been that interested in the sea.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  What would you have done? Where would you have gone if I had not pulled you here?\plain \f2\fs24 The questions hung in Darrick\'92s mind like gulls riding a favorable wind. He pushed them away. He wouldn\'92t allow himself to be touched by pain or confusion.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Andregai played the pipes, standing at Captain Tollifer\'92s side on the stern castle. The wind whipped the captain\'92s great military cloak around him. The boy\'97Lhex, the king\'92s nephew\'97stood at the captain\'92s side. When the pipes finished playing and the last echoing sad note faded away, the captain delivered the ship\'92s eulogy, speaking with quiet dignity of Mat Hu-Ring\'92s service and devotion to the Westmarch Navy and that he gave his life while rescuing{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint141}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint141}the king\'92s nephew. Despite the scattering of facts, the address was formal, almost impersonal.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick listened to the drone of words, the call of gulls sailing after\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star\plain \f2\fs24 and hoping for a trail of scraps to be left behind on the water.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Slain while rescuing the king\'92s nephew. That\'92s not how it was. Mat was killed while on a fool\'92s errand, and for worrying about me. I got him killed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick looked at the ship\'92s crew around him. Despite the action two nights ago, Mat had been the only one killed. Maybe some of the crew believed, as Maldrin said he did, that it was all just bad luck, but Darrick knew that some of them believed it was he who had killed Mat by staying too long in the cavern.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  When Captain Tollifer finished speaking, the pipes played again and the mournful sound filled the ship\'92s deck. Maldrin, clad in sailor\'92s dress whites that were worn only on inspection days or while at anchorage in Westmarch, stepped up on the other side of Mat\'92s flagcovered body on the plank. Five more sailors joined him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The pipes blew again, a going-away tune that always wished the listeners a safe trip. It was known in every maritime province Darrick had ever visited.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  When the pipes finished, Maldrin looked to Darrick, a question in his old gray eyes.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick steeled himself and gave an imperceptible nod.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93All right, then, lads,\'94 Maldrin whispered. \'93Easy as ye does it, an\'92 with all the respect ye can muster.\'94 The mate grabbed the plank and started it up, tilting it on its axis, and the other five men\'97two on one side with him and three on the other\'97lifted together. Maldrin kept a firm grip on the Westmarch flag. Maybe they covered the dead given to the sea, but the flags were not abandoned.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  As one, Darrick and the other officers turned to the starboard side, followed a half-second later by the sailors, all of them standing at rigid attention.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93For every man who dies for Westmarch,\'94 the captain spoke, \'93let him know that Westmarch lives for him.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The other officers and the crew repeated the rote saying.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint142}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint142}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick said nothing. He watched in stony silence and kept himself dwindled down to a small ember. Nothing touched him as Mat\'92s shroud-wrapped body slid from under the Westmarch flag and plummeted down the ship\'92s side to the rolling waves. The ballast rocks wrapped into the foot of the shroud to weight the body dragged it down into the blue-green sea. For a time, the white of the funeral shroud kept Mat\'92s body visible.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then even that disappeared before the ship sailed on and left it behind.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The pipes blew the disassembly, and the men drifted away.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick walked to the railing, easily riding the rise and fall of the ship that had once made him so sick in the beginning. He peered out at the ocean, but he didn\'92t see it. The stink of the blood and the soured hay in his father\'92s barn filled his nose and took his mind away from the ship and the sea. His heart hurt with the roughened leather strokes his father had used to punish him until only the feel of his fists against Darrick\'92s body would satisfy him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He made himself feel nothing at all, not even the wind that pushed into his face and ruffled his hair. He had lived much of his life numb. It had been his mistake to retreat from that.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  That night, having not eaten at all during the day because it would have meant taking mess with the other men and dealing with all the unasked questions each had, Darrick went down to the galley. Cook usually left a pot of chowder hanging over a low fire during the dogwatches.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick helped himself to the chowder, catching the young kitchen apprentice half dozing at the long table where the crew supped in shifts. Darrick filled a tin plate with the thick chowder. The young kitchen apprentice fidgeted, then got to wiping the table as if he\'92d been doing that all along.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Without speaking, ignoring the young man\'92s embarrassment{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint143}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint143}and concern that his laxness at his duties might be reported, Darrick carved a thick hunk of black bread from one of the loaves Cook had prepared, then poured himself a mug of green tea. Tea in one hand, thick hunk of bread soaking in the chowder in the tin plate, Darrick headed back up to the deck.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He stood amidships, listening to the rustle and crackle of the canvas overhead. With the knowledge they carried and the fact that they were in clear waters, Captain Tollifer had kept the sails up, taking advantage of the favorable winds.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star\plain \f2\fs24 sloshed through the moon-kissed rollers that covered the ocean\'92s surface. Occasional light flickers passed by in the water that weren\'92t just reflections of the ship\'92s lanterns posted as running lights.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Standing on the heaving deck on practiced legs, Darrick ate, managing the teacup and the tin plate in one hand\'97plate on the cup\'97and eating with his other hand. He let the black bread marinate in the chowder to soften it up, otherwise he\'92d have had to chew it for what seemed like forever to break it down. The chowder was made from shrimp and fish stock, mixed with spices from the eastern lands, and had thick chunks of potatoes. It was almost hot enough to burn the tongue even after being dipped on bread and cooled by the night winds.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick didn\'92t let himself think of the nights he and Mat had shared dogwatches together, with Mat telling wildly improbable stories he\'92d either heard somewhere or made up then and there and swore it was gospel. It had all been fun to Mat, something to keep them awake during the long, dead hours and to keep Darrick from ever thinking back to the things that had happened in Hillsfar.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92m sorry about your friend,\'94 a quiet voice said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Distanced as he was from his emotions, Darrick wasn\'92t even surprised to recognize Lhex\'92s voice behind him. He kept gazing out to sea, chewing on the latest lump of black bread and chowder he\'92d put into his mouth.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I said\'97\'94 the boy began again in a slightly louder voice.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  An uncomfortable silence stretched between them. Darrick never once turned to face the boy.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And yet you are not the king, are you?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The boy was silent for a long enough time that Darrick had thought he\'92d gone away. Darrick thought there might have been some trouble with the captain in the morning over his rudeness, but he didn\'92t care.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What are those lighted patches in the water?\'94 Lhex asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Irritated and not even wanting to feel that because long years of experience had shown him that even the smallest emotion could snowball into the feelings of entrapment that put him out of control, Darrick turned to the boy. \'93What the hell are you still doing up, boy?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I couldn\'92t sleep.\'94 The boy stood on the deck in bare feet and a sleeping gown he must have borrowed from the captain.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Darrick sat at a back table in Cross-Eyed Sal\'92s, a tavern only a couple of blocks back from Dock Street and the Mercantile Quarter. The tavern was a dive, one of the places surly sailors of meager means or ill luck ended up before they signed ship\'92s articles and went back to sea. It was a place where the lanterns were kept dim of an evening so the wenches there looked better if they weren\'92t seen as well, and the food couldn\'92t be inspected closely.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Money came into Westmarch through the piers, in the fat purses of merchants buying goods and selling goods, and in the modest coin pouches of sailors and longshoremen. The money spilled over to the shops scattered along the docks and piers first, and most of it stopped there. Little of it slopped over into the businesses crowded in back of the shops and tradesmen\'92s workplaces and the finer inns and even not-so-fine inns.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cross-Eyed Sal\'92s featured a sun-faded sign out front that showed a buxom red-haired woman served up on a steaming oyster shell with only her tresses maintaining her modesty. The tavern was located in part of the decaying layer that occupied the stretch of older buildings that had been built higher up on the hillside fronting the harbor. Over the years as Westmarch and the harbor had existed and grown, nearly all of the buildings nestled down by the sea had been torn down and rebuilt.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Only a few older buildings remained as landmarks that had been shored up by expert artisans. But behind those businesses that seined up most of the gold lay the insular layer of merchants and tavern owners who barely made{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint149}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint149}their monthly bills and the king\'92s taxes so they could stay open. The only thing that kept them going was the desperate times endured by out-of-work sailors and longshoremen.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cross-Eyed Sal\'92s had a rare crowd and was filled near to capacity. The sailors remained separate from the longshoremen because of the long-standing feud between the two groups. Sailors looked down on longshoremen for not having the guts to go to sea, and longshoremen looked down on sailors for not being a true part of the community. Both groups, however, stayed well away from the mercenaries who had shown up in the last few days.

During his leave from the ship, he\'92d remained solitary. Most of the men aboard\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star\plain \f2\fs24 had hung around him because of Mat. Blessed with his good humor and countless stories, Mat had never lacked for company, friendship, or a full mug of ale at any gathering.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  None of the crew had made an attempt to spend much time with Darrick. Besides the captain\'92s frowning disapproval of an officer\'92s fraternization with crew, Darrick had never proven himself to be good company all the time. And with Mat dead now, Darrick wanted no company at all.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  During the past nine days, Darrick had slept aboard the ship rather than in the arms of any of the many willing women, and he\'92d marked time in one dive after another much like Cross-Eyed Sal\'92s. Normally, Mat would have dragged Darrick into any number of festive inns or gotten them invitations to events hosted by the lesser politicos in Westmarch. Somehow, Mat had managed to meet several wives and courtesans of those men while investigating Westmarch\'92s museums, art galleries, and churches\'97interests that Darrick had not shared. Darrick had even found the parties annoying.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick found the bottom of his mulled wine again and looked around for the tavern wench who had been serving{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint150}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint150}him. She stood three tables away, in the crook of a big mercenary\'92s arm. Her laughter seemed obscene to Darrick, and his anger rose before he could throttle it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Girl,\'94 he called impatiently, thumping the tin tankard against the scarred tabletop.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The wench extricated herself from the mercenary\'92s grasp, giggling and pushing against him in a manner meant to free herself and be seductive at the same time. She made her way across the packed room and took Darrick\'92s tankard.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The group of mercenaries scowled at Darrick and talked among themselves in low voices.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick ignored them and leaned back against the wall behind him. He\'92d been in bars like this before countless times, and he\'92d seen hundreds of men like the mercenaries. Normally he was among ship\'92s crew, for it was Captain Tollifer\'92s standing order that no crewman drink alone. But since they\'92d been in port this time, Darrick had only drunk alone, making his way back to the ship each morning before daybreak any time he didn\'92t have an early watch.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The wench brought back Darrick\'92s filled tankard. He paid her, adding a modest tip that drew no favoring glance. Normally Mat would have parted generously with his money, endearing himself to the serving wenches. Tonight, Darrick didn\'92t care. All he wanted was a full tankard till he took his leave.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He returned his attention to the cold food on the wooden serving platter before him. The meal consisted of stringy meat and scorched potatoes, covered with flecks of thin gravy that looked no more appetizing than hound saliva. The tavern could get away with such weak fare because the city was burgeoning with mercenaries feeding at the king\'92s coffers. Darrick took a bit of meat and chewed it, watching as the big mercenary got up from his table, flanked by two of his friends.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Under the table, Darrick pulled his cutlass across his lap. He\'92d made a practice of eating with his left hand, leaving his right hand free.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Hey there, swabbie,\'94 the big mercenary growled, pulling out the chair across the table from Darrick and seating himself uninvited. The way he pronounced the term let Darrick know the man had meant the address as an insult.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Although the longshoremen rode the sailors about being visitors to the city and not truly of it, the mercenaries were even less so. Mercenaries touted themselves as brave warriors, men used to fighting, and when any sailor made the same claim, the mercenaries tried to downplay the bravery of the sailors.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick waited, knowing the encounter wasn\'92t going to end well and actually welcoming it all the same. He didn\'92t know if there was a single man in the room who would stand with him, and he didn\'92t care.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You shouldn\'92t go interrupting a young girl what\'92s going about her business the way that young wench was,\'94 the mercenary said. He was young and blond, broad-faced and gap-toothed, a man who had gotten by on sheer size a lot of the time. The scars on his face and arms spoke up for a past history of violence as well. He wore cheap leather armor and carried a short sword with a wire-wrapped hilt at his side.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The other two mercenaries were about the same age, though they showed less experience. Darrick guessed that they were following their companion. Both of them looked a little uneasy about the confrontation.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick sipped from the tankard. Awarm glow filled his belly, and he knew only part of it was from the wine. \'93This is my table,\'94 he said, \'93and I\'92m not inviting company.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You looked lonely,\'94 the big man said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Have your eyesight checked,\'94 Darrick suggested.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The big man scowled. \'93You\'92re not an overly friendly sort.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Darrick agreed. \'93Now, you\'92ve got the right of that.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The big man leaned forward, thumping his massive elbows on the table and resting his square shelf of a chin over his interlaced fingers. \'93I don\'92t like you.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint152}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint152}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick gripped his cutlass beneath the tabletop and leaned back, letting the wall behind him brace his shoulders. The flickering candle flame on a nearby table drew hollows on the big man\'92s face.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Syrnon,\'94 one of the other men said, pulling at his friend\'92s sleeve. \'93This man has officer\'92s braid on his collar.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Syrnon\'92s big blue eyes narrowed as he glanced at Darrick\'92s neckline. An oak leaf cluster was pinned to Darrick\'92s collar, two garnets denoting his rank. Putting it on had gotten to be such a habit he\'92d forgotten about it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You an officer on one of the king\'92s ships?\'94 Syrnon asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye,\'94 Darrick taunted. \'93You going to let fear of the king\'92s reprisal for attacking a ship\'92s officer in his navy cow you?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Syrnon,\'94 the other man said. \'93We\'92d be better off taking our leave of this man.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Maybe the man would have left then. He wasn\'92t too drunk to forget about listening to reason, and Westmarch dungeons weren\'92t rumored to be hospitable.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Go,\'94 Darrick said softly, giving in to the black mood that filled him, \'93and don\'92t forget to tuck your tail between your legs as you do.\'94 In the past, Mat had always sensed when Darrick\'92s black moods had settled on him, and Mat had always found a way to cajole him out of the mood or get them into areas where that self-destructive bent wouldn\'92t completely manifest itself.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But Mat wasn\'92t there tonight, and hadn\'92t been around for nine long days.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Howling with rage, Syrnon stood and reached across the table, intending to grab Darrick\'92s shirt. Darrick leaned forward and head-butted the big mercenary in the face, breaking his nose. Blood gushed from Syrnon\'92s nostrils as he stumbled back.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The other two mercenaries tried to stand.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick swung his cutlass, catching one of the men alongside the temple with the flat of the blade and knocking him out. Before the unconscious man had time to drop,{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint153}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint153}Darrick swung on the other man. The mercenary fumbled for the sword sheathed at his waist. Before his opponent could get his weapon clear, Darrick kicked him in the chest, driving the mercenary from his feet and back onto a nearby table. The mercenary took the whole table down with him, and four angry warriors rose to their feet, cursing the man who had landed upon the table, and they cursed Darrick as well.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Syrnon pulled his short sword and drew it back, causing nearby men to duck and dodge way. Curses and harsh oaths followed his movement.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Vaulting to the table, Darrick leapt over Syrnon\'92s sword blow, flipped forward\'97feeling his senses spin for a moment from all he\'92d had to drink\'97and landed on his feet behind the big mercenary. Syrnon spun, his face a mask of crimson from his broken nose, and spat blood as he cursed Darrick. The big mercenary swung his short sword at Darrick\'92s head.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick parried the man\'92s attack with the cutlass. Steel rang against steel inside the tavern. Holding the man\'92s blade trapped, Darrick balled his left fist and slammed it into Syrnon\'92s head. Flesh split along the mercenary\'92s cheek. Darrick hit his opponent twice more and felt immense satisfaction with his efforts. Syrnon was bigger than him, as much bigger as his father had been in the back of the butcher\'92s shop. Only Darrick was no longer a frightened boy too small and too unskilled to defend himself. He hit Syrnon one more time, driving the big man backward.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Syrnon\'92s face showed abuse. His right eye promising to swell shut, a split lip and a split ear joined the split over his cheekbone.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick\'92s hand throbbed from the impacts, but he barely took notice of it. The darkness within him was loose now, in a way he\'92d never seen it. The emotion rattled inside him, growing stronger. Syrnon flailed out unexpectedly, catching Darrick in the face with a hard-knuckled hand. Darrick\'92s head popped backward, and his senses reeled for{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint154}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint154}a moment as the coppery taste of blood filled his mouth and the sour stench of straw filled his nose.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Nobody thinks you look like me, boy!\plain \f2\fs24 The voice of Orvan Lang crescendoed through Darrick\'92s head.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Why is it, do you think, that a boy don\'92t look like his father? Everybody\'92s tongue\'92s wagging. And me, I love your mother, damn me for a fool.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Parrying the mercenary\'92s desperate attack again, Darrick stepped forward once more. His sword skill was known throughout the Westmarch Navy by any who had faced him or stood at his side when he\'92d fought pirates or smugglers.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  For a time after he and Mat had arrived in Westmarch from Hillsfar, Darrick had trained with a fencing master, exchanging work and willingness for training. For six years, Darrick had repaired and sanded the fencing room floor and walls and chopped wood, and in turn began the training of others while pursuing a career in the Westmarch Navy.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  That training had kept Darrick balanced for a time, until Master Coro\'92s death in a duel with a duke over a woman\'92s honor. Darrick had tracked the two assassins down, as well as the duke, and killed them all. He\'92d also gotten the attention of the commodore of the Westmarch Navy, who had known about the duel and the assassination. Master Coro also trained several of the ship\'92s officers and practiced with captains. As a result, Darrick and Mat had been assigned berths on their first ship.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  After Master Coro was no longer around, the tightfisted control aboard the navy ship had granted Darrick a kind of peace, providing a structured environment. Mat had helped.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Now, with this battle at hand, Darrick felt right. Losing Mat and then waiting for days to be given some kind of meaningful assignment had grated on his nerves.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star,\plain \f2\fs24 once a home and a haven, was now a reminder that Mat was gone. Guilt mortared every plank aboard the ship, and Darrick longed for action of any kind.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick played with the mercenary, and the darkness stirred inside his soul. Several times during the years that{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint155}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint155}had passed since he\'92d escaped Hillsfar, he had thought about going back and seeing his father\'97especially when Mat had returned to visit his family. Darrick felt no pull toward his mother; she had allowed the beatings his father had given him to go on because she had her own life to live, and being married to one of the town\'92s successful butchers had accommodated her lifestyle.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick had chosen to keep the darkness inside him walled up and put away.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  There was no stopping it now, though. Darrick beat back the big mercenary\'92s defenses, chasing the man steadily backward. Syrnon called out for help, but even the other mercenaries appeared loath to step into the fray.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A whistle shrilled in warning.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Part of Darrick knew the whistle signaled the arrival of the king\'92s Peacekeepers. All of the Peacekeepers were tough men and women dedicated to keeping the king\'92s peace inside the city walls.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The mercenaries and few sailors inside the tavern gave way at once. Anyone who didn\'92t recognize a Peacekeeper\'92s authority spent a night in the dungeon.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Caught up in the black emotions that had taken hold of him, Darrick didn\'92t hesitate. He kept advancing, beating the big mercenary back till there was nowhere to run. With a final riposte, Darrick stripped the man of his weapon, knocking it away with a practiced twist of his wrist.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The mercenary flattened against the wall, standing on his toes, with Darrick\'92s cutlass at his throat. \'93Please,\'94 he whispered in a dry croak.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick held the man there. There didn\'92t seem to be enough air in the room. He heard the whistle blasts behind him, one of them closing in.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Put the sword away,\'94 a woman\'92s calm voice ordered him. \'93Put it away now.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick turned, bringing his cutlass around, intending to back the woman off. But when he attempted to parry the staff she held, she reversed the weapon and thumped it into his chest.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint156}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint156}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A wild electrical surge rushed through Darrick, and he fell.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Morning sunlight streamed through the bars of the small window above the bunk chained to a stone wall. Darrick blinked his eyes open and stared at the sunlight. He hadn\'92t been taken to the dungeon proper. He was grateful for that, though much surprised.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Feeling as though his head were going to explode, Darrick sat up. The bunk creaked beneath him and pulled at the two chains on the wall. He rested his feet on the floor and gazed out through the bars that made up the fourth wall of the small holding cell that was an eight-foot by eight-foot by eight-foot box. Sour straw filled the thin mattress that almost covered the bunk. The material covering the mattress showed stains where past guests had relieved themselves and thrown up on it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick\'92s stomach whirled and revolted, threatening to empty. He lurched toward the slop bucket in the forward corner of the holding cell. Sickness coiled through him, venting itself in violent heaves, leaving him barely enough strength to hang on to the bars.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A man\'92s barking laughter ignited in the shadows that filled the building.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Resting on his haunches, not certain if the sickness was completely purged, Darrick glared across the space between his cell and the one on the other side.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A shaggy-haired man dressed in warrior\'92s leathers sat cross-legged on the bunk inside that cell. Brass armbands marked him for an out-of-town mercenary, as did the tribal tattoos on his face and arms.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93So how are you feeling this morning?\'94 the man asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick ignored him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The man stood up from the bunk and crossed to the bars of his own cell. Gripping the bars, he said, \'93What is it about you, sailor, that\'92s got everybody in here in such an uproar?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lowering his head back to the foul-smelling bucket, Darrick let go again.

He felt as if he\'92d been keelhauled and heaved up against the barnacle-covered hull. Several of the Peacekeepers carried mystically charged gems mounted in staffs that provided debilitating jolts to incapacitate prisoners.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93One of the guards suggested they cave your head in and be done with it,\'94 the warrior said. \'93But another guard said you was some kind of hero. That you\'92d seen the demon everybody in Westmarch is so afraid of these days.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick clung to the bars and took shallow breaths.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Is that true?\'94 the warrior asked. \'93Because all I saw last night was a drunk.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The ratchet of a heavy key turning in a latch filled the holding area, drawing curses from men and women held in other cells. A door creaked open.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick leaned back against the wall to one side of the bars so he could peer out into the narrow aisle.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A jailer clad in a Peacekeeper\'92s uniform with sergeant\'92s stripes appeared first. Dressed in his long cloak, Captain Tollifer followed him.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Despite the sickness raging in his belly, Darrick rose to his feet as years of training took over. He saluted, hoping his stomach wouldn\'92t choose that moment to purge again.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Then let\'92s allow me to stumble through this gross aberration in what I\'92ve come to expect from you on my own,\'94 Captain Tollifer said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye, sir.\'94 Unable to hold himself back anymore, Darrick turned and threw up into the bucket.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And know this, Mr. Lang,\'94 the captain said. \'93I\'92ll not suffer such behavior on a regular basis.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No, sir,\'94 Darrick said, so weak now he couldn\'92t get up from his knees.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Very well, jailer,\'94 the captain said. \'93I\'92ll have him out of there now.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick threw up again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Maybe in a few more minutes,\'94 the jailer suggested. \'93I\'92ve got a pot of tea on up front if you\'92ll join me. Give the young man another few minutes to himself; maybe he\'92ll be more hospitable company.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Embarrassed but with anger eating away at his control, Darrick listened to the two men walking away. Mat would have at least joined him in the cell, laughing it up at his expense but not deserting him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick threw up again and saw the skeleton take Mat from the harbor cliff one more time. Only this time as they{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint159}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint159}fell, Darrick could see the demon standing over them, laughing as they headed for the dark river below.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You can\'92t take him yet,\'94 the healer protested. \'93I\'92ve got at least three more stitches needed to piece this wound over his eye together.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick sat stoically on the small stool in the healer\'92s surgery and stared with his good eye at Maldrin standing in the narrow, shadow-lined doorway. Other men passed by outside, all of them wounded, ill, or diseased. Somewhere down the hallway, a woman screamed in labor, swearing that she was birthing a demon.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The first mate didn\'92t look happy. He met Darrick\'92s gaze for just a moment, then looked away.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick thought maybe Maldrin was just angry, but he believed there was some embarrassment there as well. This wasn\'92t the first time of late that Maldrin had been forced to come searching for him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick glanced at the healer\'92s surgery, seeing the shelves filled with bottles of potions and powders; jars of leaves, dried berries, and bark; and bags that contained rocks and stones with curative properties.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The healer was located off Dock Street and was an older man whom many sailors and longshoremen used for injuries. The strong odors of all the salves and medicants the thin man used on the people he gave care to filled the air.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Fixing another piece of thin catgut on the curved needle he held, the healer leaned in and pierced the flesh over Darrick\'92s right eye. Darrick never moved, never even flinched or closed his eye.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Are you sure you wouldn\'92t like something for the pain?\'94 the healer asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92m sure.\'94 Darrick stepped away from the pain, placing it in the same part of his mind that he\'92d built all those years ago to handle the hell his father had put him through. That special place in his mind could hold a whole lot more than the discomfort the healer handed out. Darrick looked up at Maldrin. \'93Does the captain know?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint160}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint160}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Maldrin sighed. \'93That ye got into another fight an\'92 tore up yet another tavern? Aye, he knows, skipper. Caron is over there now, seein\'92 about the damages an\'92 such ye\'92ll owe. Seein\'92 as how much damage ye been payin\'92 for lately, I don\'92t know how ye\'92ve had the wherewithal to drink.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I didn\'92t start this fight,\'94 Darrick said, but the protest was dulled by weeks of using it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93So says ye,\'94 Maldrin agreed. \'93But the captain, he\'92s heard from near to a dozen other men that ye wouldn\'92t walk away when the chance presented itself.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick\'92s voice hardened. \'93I don\'92t walk away, Maldrin. And I damn sure don\'92t run from trouble.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Ye should.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Have you ever known me to retreat from a fight?\'94 Darrick knew he was trying to put everything he\'92d done that night into some kind of perspective for himself. His struggles to find something right about the violence that he constantly got himself into during shore leave had only escalated.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93A fight,\'94 Maldrin said, folding his big arms over his broad, thick chest. \'93No. I\'92ve never seen ye back down from action we took together. But ye got to learn when to cut yer losses. The things them men say in them places ye hang out, why, that ain\'92t nothin\'92 to be a-fightin\'92 over. Ye know as well as I that a sailin\'92 man picks his battles. But ye\'97by the blessed Light, skipper\'97ye\'92re just fightin\'92 to be fightin\'92.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick closed his good eye. The other was swollen shut and filled with blood. The sailor he\'92d fought in Gargan\'92s Greased Eel had fought with an enchanted weapon and snapped into action quicker than Darrick had thought.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93How many fights have ye had in the last two months, skipper?\'94 Maldrin asked in a softer voice.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick hesitated. \'93I don\'92t know.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Seventeen,\'94 Maldrin said. \'93Seventeen fights. All of \'92em partly instigated by yer own self.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick felt the newest suture pull as the healer tied it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The Light must be favorin\'92 ye is all that I can tell,\'94{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint161}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint161}Maldrin said, \'93for they ain\'92t nobody what\'92s been killed yet. An\'92 ye\'92re still alive to tell of it yer own self.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ve been careful,\'94 Darrick said, and regretted trying to make an excuse at once.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93A man bein\'92 careful, skipper,\'94 Maldrin said, \'93why, he\'92d never get in them fixes ye been into. Hell\'92s bells, most of the trouble ye\'92re in, a man what\'92s got a thought in his damned head would think maybe he should ought not be in them places.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick silently agreed. But the portent of trouble in those places had been exactly what had drawn him there. He wasn\'92t thinking when he was fighting, and he wasn\'92t in danger of thinking on things too long or too often when he was drinking and waiting for someone to pick a fight with.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The healer prepared another stitch.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What about the captain?\'94 Darrick asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Skipper,\'94 Maldrin said in a quiet voice, \'93Cap\'92n Tollifer appreciates everythin\'92 ye done. An\'92 he ain\'92t about to forget it. But he\'92s a prideful man, too, an\'92 him havin\'92 to deal with one of his own always fightin\'92 while in port during these edgy times, why, it ain\'92t settin\'92 well with him at all. An\'92 ye damn sure don\'92t need me tellin\'92 ye this.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick agreed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The healer started in with the needle again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Ye need help, skipper,\'94 Maldrin said. \'93Cap\'92n knows it. I know it. Crew knows it. Ye\'92re the only one what seems convinced ye don\'92t.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taking a towel from his knee, the healer blotted blood from Darrick\'92s eye, poured fresh salt water over the wound, and started putting in the final stitch.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Ye ain\'92t the only man what\'92s lost a friend,\'94 Maldrin croaked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I didn\'92t say I was.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93An\'92 me,\'94 Maldrin went on as if he hadn\'92t heard Darrick, \'93I\'92m near to losin\'92 two. I don\'92t want to see you leave\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star,\plain \f2\fs24 skipper. Not if\'92n there\'92s a way I can help.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92m not worth losing any sleep over, Maldrin,\'94 Darrick said in a flat voice. The thing that scared him most was that{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint162}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint162}he felt that way, but he knew it was only his father\'92s words. They were never far from his mind. He\'92d found he could escape his father\'92s fists, but he\'92d never been able to escape the man\'92s harsh words. Only Mat had made him feel differently. None of the other friendships he\'92d made helped, nor did remembering any of the women he\'92d been with over the years. Not even Maldrin could reach him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But he knew why. Everything Darrick touched would eventually turn to dung. His father had told him that, and it was turning out true. He\'92d lost Mat, and now he was losing\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star\plain \f2\fs24 and his career in the Westmarch Navy.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Mayhap ye ain\'92t,\'94 Maldrin said. \'93Mayhap ye ain\'92t.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick ran, heart pounding so hard that the infection in his week-old eye wound thundered painfully. His breath came in short gasps as he held his cutlass at his side and dashed through the alleys around the Mercantile Quarter. Reaching Dock Street, he turned his stride toward Fleet Street, the thoroughfare that went through the Military District where the Westmarch Navy harbor was.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He saw the navy frigates in the distance, tall masts thrust up into the low-lying fog that hugged the gulf coastline. A few ships sailed out over the curve of the world, following a favorable breeze away from Westmarch.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  So far, Raithen\'92s pirates had presented no real threat to the city and may even have disbanded, but other pirates had gathered, preying on the busy shipping lanes as Westmarch brought in more and more goods to support the navy, army, and mercenaries. With almost two and a half months gone and no sighting of Kabraxis, the king was beginning to doubt the reports\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star\plain \f2\fs24 had brought back. Even now, the main problems in Westmarch had become the restlessness of the mercenaries at not having a goal or any real action to occupy them and the dwindling food stores that the city had not yet been able to replace since the action against Tristram.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick cursed the fog that covered the city in steel gray.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint163}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint163}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He\'92d woken in an alley, not knowing if he\'92d gone to sleep there or if he\'92d been thrown there from one of the nearby taverns. He hadn\'92t awakened until after cock\'92s crow, and\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star\plain \f2\fs24 was due to sail that morning.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He damned himself for a fool, knowing he should have stayed aboard ship. But he hadn\'92t been able to. No one aboard, including the captain and Maldrin, talked with him anymore. He had become an embarrassment, something his father had always told him he was.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Out of breath, he made the final turn toward Spinnaker Bridge, one of the last checkpoints where nonnaval personnel were turned back from entering the Military District. He fumbled inside his stained blouse for his papers.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Four guards stepped up to block his way. They were hard-faced men with weapons that showed obvious care. One of them held up a hand.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick stopped, breathing hard, his injured eye throbbing painfully. \'93Ship\'92s Officer Second Grade Lang,\'94 he gasped.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The leader of the guards looked at Darrick doubtfully but took the papers Darrick offered. He scanned them, noting the captain\'92s seal embossed upon the pages.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Says here you sail with\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star,\'94\plain \f2\fs24 the guard said, offering the papers back.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye,\'94 Darrick said, raking the sea with his good eye. He didn\'92t recognize any of the ships sailing out into the gulf as his. Maybe he was in luck.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star\plain \f2\fs24 sailed hours ago,\'94 the guardsman said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick\'92s heart plummeted through his knees. \'93No,\'94 he whispered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93By rights with you missing your ship like you have,\'94 the guardsman said, \'93I ought to run you in and let the commodore deal with you. But from the looks of you, I\'92d say getting beaten up and robbed will stand as a good excuse. I\'92ll make an entry of it in my log. Should stand you in good stead if you\'92re called before a naval inquest.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  You\'92d be doing me no favors,\plain \f2\fs24 Darrick thought. Any man caught missing from his ship for no good reason was hung{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint164}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint164}for dereliction of duty. He turned and gazed out to sea, watching the gulls hunting through the water for scraps carried out by the tide. The cries of the birds sounded mournful and hollow, filtering over the crash of the surf against the shore.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  If Captain Tollifer had sailed without him, Darrick knew there no longer remained a berth for him aboard\plain \f2\i\fs24 Lonesome Star.\plain \f2\fs24 His career in the Westmarch Navy was over, and he had no idea what lay ahead of him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He wanted nothing more than to die, but he couldn\'92t do that\'97he wouldn\'92t do that\'97because it would mean that his father would win even after all these years. He walled himself off from his pain and loss, and he turned away from the sea, following the street back into Westmarch. He had no money. The possibility of missing meals didn\'92t bother him, but he knew he\'92d want to drink again that night. By the Light, he wanted to drink right now.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Buyard Cholik looked up from the comfortable sofa that took up one long wall of the coach he traveled in. Drawn by six horses on three axles, the coach had all the amenities of home. Built-in shelves held his priestly supplies, clothing, and personal belongings. Lamps screwed into the walls and fluted for smoke discharge through the sides of the coach provided light to read by. Since leaving the ruins of Tauruk\'92s Port and Ransim almost three months ago, almost all of his time had been spent reading the arcane texts Kabraxis had provided him and practicing the sorcery the demon had been teaching him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What is it?\'94 Cholik asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The man speaking stood outside on the platform attached to the bottom of the coach. Cholik made no move to open one of the shuttered windows so that he might see the man. Since Kabraxis had changed him, altering his mind and his body\'97in addition to removing decades from his age\'97Cholik felt close to none of the men who had survived the demon\'92s arrival and the attack of Raithen\'92s pirates. Several of them were new, gathered from the small towns the caravan had passed through on its way to its eventual destination.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We are approaching Bramwell, master,\'94 the man said. \'93I thought you might want to know.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes,\'94 Cholik replied. He could tell by the level ride of the coach that the long, winding, uphill trek they\'92d been making for hours had passed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik marked his place in the book he\'92d been reading with a thin braid of human tongues that had turned leathery{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint166}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint166}over the years. Sometimes, with the proper spell in place, the tongues read aloud from profane passages. The book was writ in blood upon paper made from human skin and bound in children\'92s teeth. Most of the other books Kabraxis had provided over the past months were crafted in things that Cholik in his past life as a priest of the Zakarum Church would have believed to be even more horrendous.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The bookmarker made of tongues whispered a sibilant protest at being put away, inciting a small amount of guilt in Cholik as he felt certain Kabraxis had spelled them to do. Nearly all of his days were spent reading, yet it never seemed enough.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Moving with the grace of a man barely entering his middle years, Cholik opened the coach\'92s door, stepped out onto the platform, then climbed the small hand-carved ladder that led up to the coach\'92s peaked, thatched roof. A small ledge was rather like a widow\'92s walk on some of the more affluent houses in Westmarch where merchanter captains\'92 wives walked to see if their husbands arrived safely back from sea.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The coach had been one of the first things Cholik had purchased with the gold and jewels he and his converted priests had carted out of the caverns with Kabraxis\'92s blessing. In its past life, the coach had belonged to a merchant prince who specialized in overland trading. Only two days before Cholik had bought the coach, the merchant prince had suffered debilitating losses and a mysterious illness that had killed him in a matter of hours. Faced with certain bankruptcy, the executor of the prince\'92s goods had sold the coach to Cholik\'92s emissaries.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Standing on the small widow\'92s walk, aware of the immense forest around him, Cholik looked over the half-dozen wagons that preceded the coach. Another half-dozen wagons, all loaded down with the things that Kabraxis had ordered salvaged from Tauruk\'92s Port, trailed behind Cholik\'92s coach.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A winding road cut through the heart of the forest. Cholik couldn\'92t remember the forest\'92s name at the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint167}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint167}moment, but he had never seen it before. His travels from Westmarch had always been by ship, and he\'92d never been to Bramwell as young as he now was.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  At the end of the winding road lay the city of Bramwell, a suburb north-northwest of Westmarch. Centuries ago, situated among the highlands as it was, the city had occupied a position of prominence that competed with Westmarch. Bramwell had been far enough away from Westmarch that its economy was its own. Farmers and fishermen lived in the tiny city, descendants of families that had lived there for generations, sailing the same ships and plowing the same lands as their ancestors had. In the old days, Bramwell\'92s sailors had hunted whales and sold the oil. Now, the whaling fleets had become a handful of diehard families who stubbornly got by in a hardscrabble existence more with pride and a deep reluctance to change than out of necessity.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Almost ancient, Bramwell was constructed of buildings two and three stories tall from stones cut and carried down from the mountains. Peaked roofs crafted with thatching dyed a dozen different shades of green mimicked the forest surrounding the city on three sides. The fourth side fronted the Gulf of Westmarch, where a breakwater had been built of rock dug from the mountains to protect the harbor from the harsh seasons of the sea.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  From atop the coach and atop the mountains, Cholik surveyed the city that would be his home during the first of Kabraxis\'92s conquests. An empire, Cholik told himself as he gazed out onto the unsuspecting city, would begin there. He rode on the platform, rocking back and forth as the heavy-duty springs of the coach compensated for the road\'92s failings, watching as the city drew closer.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hours later, Cholik stood beside the Sweetwater River that fed Bramwell. The river ran deep and true between broad, stone-covered banks. The waterway also provided more harbor space for smaller craft that plied the city\'92s trade farther inland and graced the lands with a plenitude{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint168}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint168}of wells and irrigation for the farms that made checkerboards outside the city proper.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  At the eastern end of the city where the loggers and craftsmen gathered and where shops and markets had sprung up years ago, Cholik halted the caravan in the campgrounds that were open to all who hoped to trade with the Bramwell population.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Children had gathered around the coach and the wagons immediately, hoping for a traveling minstrel show. Cholik didn\'92t disappoint them, offering the troupe of entertainers he\'92d hired as the caravan had journeyed north from Tauruk\'92s Port. They\'92d taken the overland route, a long and arduous event compared with travel by sea, but they had avoided the Westmarch Navy as well. Cholik doubted that anyone who had once known him would recognize him since his youth had been returned, but he hadn\'92t wanted to take the chance, and Kabraxis had been patient.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The entertainers gamboled and clowned, performing physical feats that seemed astounding and combining witty poems and snippets of exchanges that had the gathering audience roaring with laughter. The juggling and acrobatics, while pipes and drums played in the background, drew amazed comments from the families.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik stood inside the coach and watched through a covered window. The festive atmosphere didn\'92t fit with how he\'92d been trained to think of religious practices. New converts to the Zakarum Church weren\'92t entertained and wooed in such a manner, although some of the smaller churches did.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Still disapproving, are you?\'94 a deep voice asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Recognizing Kabraxis\'92s voice, Cholik stood and turned. He knew the demon hadn\'92t entered the coach in the conventional means, but he didn\'92t know from where Kabraxis had traveled before stepping into the coach.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Old habits are hard to break,\'94 Cholik said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Like changing your religious beliefs?\'94 Kabraxis asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kabraxis stood before Cholik wearing a dead man\'92s{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint169}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint169}body. Upon his decision to go among the humans and look for a city to establish as a beachhead to begin their campaign, Kabraxis had killed a merchant, sacrificing the man\'92s soul to unforgiving darkness. Once the mortal remains of the man were nothing more than an empty shell, Kabraxis had labored for three days and nights with the blackest arcane spells available, finally managing to fit himself into the corpse.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Although Cholik had never witnessed something like that, Kabraxis had assured him that it was sometimes done, though not without danger. When the host body was taken over a month ago, it had been that of a young man who had not yet seen thirty. Now the man looked much older than Cholik, like a man in his twilight years. The flesh was baggy and loose, wrinkled and crisscrossed by hair-fine scars that marred his features. His black hair had gone colorless gray, his eyes from brown to pale ash.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Are you all right?\'94 Cholik asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The old man smiled, but it was with an expression Cholik recognized as Kabraxis\'92s. \'93I\'92ve put many harsh demands on this body. But its use is almost at an end.\'94 He stepped past Cholik and peered out the window.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What are you doing here?\'94 Cholik asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I came to watch you observe the festivities of the people coming to see you,\'94 Kabraxis said. \'93I knew that this many people around you, and so many of them happy and needing diversion, would prove unnerving for you. Life goes much easier for you if you can maintain a somber vigilance over it.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93These people will know us as entertainers,\'94 Cholik said, \'93not as conduits to a new religion that will help them with their lives.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Oh,\'94 Kabraxis said, \'93I\'92ll help them with their lives. In fact, I wanted to have a word with you about how this evening\'92s meeting will go.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Excitement flared within Cholik. After two months of being on the road, of planning to found a church and build a power base that would eventually seek to draw its constituency{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint170}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint170}from the Zakarum Church, it felt good to know that they were about to start.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Bramwell is the place, then?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes,\'94 Kabraxis said. \'93There is old power located within this town. Power that I can tap into that will shape your destiny and my conquest. Tonight, you will lay the first stone in the church we have discussed for the past month. But it won\'92t be of stone and mortar as you think. Rather, it will be of believers.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The comment left Cholik cold. He wanted an edifice, a building that would dwarf the Zakarum Church in Westmarch. \'93We will need a church.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We will have a church,\'94 Kabraxis said. \'93But having a church anchors you in one spot. Although I\'92ve tried to teach you this, you\'92ve still not learned. But a belief\'97Buyard Cholik, First Chosen of the Black Road\'97a belief transcends all physical boundaries and leaves its mark on the ages. That\'92s what we want.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik said nothing, but visions of a grand church continued to dance in his head.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ve given you an extended life,\'94 Kabraxis said. \'93Few humans will ever achieve the years that you\'92ve lived so far without the effects of my gift. Would you want to spend all the coming years in one place, looking only over the triumphs you\'92ve already wrought?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik walked out of the coach and toward the gathering area. He wore his best robe, but it was of a modest style that wouldn\'92t turn away those who were poor.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  At least three hundred people ringed the clearing where the caravan had stopped. Other wagons, some of them loaded with straw, apples, and livestock, formed another ring outside Cholik\'92s. Still more wagons, empty of any goods, made seating areas beneath the spreading trees.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Ah,\'94 one man whispered, \'93here comes the speechmaker. The fun and games are over now, I\'92ll warrant.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Aware that he was losing part of the audience the performers had brought in for him, knowing not to make any attempt to speak to them of anything smacking of responsibility or donations, Cholik walked to the center of the clearing and brought out the metal bucket containing black ash that Kabraxis had made and presented to him. Speaking a single word of power that the audience couldn\'92t hear, he threw out the ashes.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The ashes roiled from the bucket in a dense black cloud that paused in midair. The long stream of ash twisted like a snake on a hot road as it floated on the mild breeze wafting through the clearing. Abruptly, the ash thinned and shot forward, creating whorls and loops that dropped over the ground. In places, the lines of ash crossed over other lines, but the lines didn\'92t touch. Instead, the loops and whorls stayed ten feet away, creating enough distance that a man might walk under.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sight of the thin line of ash hanging in the air caught the attention of the audience. Perhaps a mage might be{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint172}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint172}able to do something like that, but not a typical priest. Enough curiosity was created that most people wanted to see what Cholik would do next.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  When the line of ash ended its run, it glowed with deep violet fire, competing just for a moment with the deepening twilight darkening the eastern sky and the embers of the sunset west over the Gulf of Westmarch.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik faced the audience, his eyes meeting theirs. \'93I bring you power,\'94 he said. \'93A path that will carry you to the dreams you\'92ve always had but were denied by misfortune and outdated dogma.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  An undercurrent of conversation started around the clearing. Several voices rose in anger. The populace of Bramwell clung to their belief in Zakarum.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93There is another way to the Light,\'94 Cholik said. \'93That path lies along the Way of Dreams. Dien-Ap-Sten, Prophet of the Light, created this path for his children, so that they might have their needs met and their secret wishes answered.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The Zakarum Church already does that,\'94 a grizzled old man in a patched priest\'92s robe stated. \'93We don\'92t need a pretender here digging into our vaults.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik pushed aside his stung pride. That chore was made even harder by the knowledge that he could have{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint173}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint173}blasted the life from the man with one of the spells he\'92d learned from Kabraxis. After he\'92d become one of Zakarum\'92s priests and even while he was wearing the robe of a novice, no one had dared challenge him in such a manner.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Crossing the clearing, Cholik stopped in front of a large family with a young boy so crippled and wasted by disease that he looked like a stumbling corpse.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The father stepped up in front of Cholik protectively. The man gripped the knife sheathed at his waist.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Good sir,\'94 Cholik said, \'93I see that your son is afflicted.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The farmer gazed around self-consciously. \'93By the fever that come through Bramwell eight years ago. My boy ain\'92t the only one that was hurt by it.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93He hasn\'92t been right since the fever.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Nervously, the farmer shook his head. \'93None of them has. Most died within a week of getting it.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What would you give to have one more healthy son to help you work your farm?\'94 Cholik asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I ain\'92t going to have my boy hurt or made fun of,\'94 the farmer warned.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I will do neither,\'94 Cholik promised. \'93Please trust me.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Confusion filled the man\'92s face. He looked at the short, stocky woman who had to be the mother of the nine children who sat in their wagon.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Boy,\'94 Cholik said, addressing the young boy, \'93would you stay a burden to your family?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Hey,\'94 the farmer protested. \'93He ain\'92t no burden, and I\'92ll fight the man that says he is.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik waited. As an ordained priest of the Zakarum Church, he\'92d have had the father penalized at once for daring to speak to him in such a manner.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Wait,\plain \f2\fs24 Kabraxis whispered in Cholik\'92s mind.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik waited, knowing the audience\'92s full attention was upon him. It would be decided here, he told himself, whether the audience stayed or went.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Something lit the boy\'92s eyes. His head, looking bulbous on his thin shoulders and narrow chest, swiveled toward his father. Reaching up with an arthritic hand with fingers{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint174}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint174}that had to have been painful to him all the time and could barely be expected to enable him to feed himself, the boy tugged on his father\'92s arm.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Father,\'94 the boy said, \'93let me go with the priest.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The farmer started to shake his head. \'93Effirn, I don\'92t know if this is right for you. I don\'92t want you to get your hopes up. The healers at the Zakarum Church haven\'92t been able to cure you.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I know,\'94 the boy said. \'93But I believe in this man. Let me try.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The farmer glanced at his wife. She nodded, tears flashing diamondlike in her eyes. Looking up at Cholik, the farmer said, \'93I hold you accountable for what happens to my son, priest.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You may,\'94 Cholik said politely, \'93but I assure you the healing that young Effirn will shortly enjoy shall be the blessing of Dien-Ap-Sten. I am not skilled enough to answer this boy\'92s wish to be healed and whole.\'94 He glanced at the boy and offered his hand.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The boy tried to stand, but his withered legs wouldn\'92t hold him. He folded his hand with its twisted and crooked fingers inside Cholik\'92s hand.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik marveled at the weakness of the boy. It was hard to remember when he\'92d been so weak himself, but it had been only scant months ago. He helped the boy to his feet. Around the clearing almost every voice was stilled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Come, boy,\'94 Cholik said. \'93Place your faith in me.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I do,\'94 Effirn replied.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Together, they walked across the clearing. Not quite to the nearest end of the long rope of black ash that still sparked with violent fire, the boy\'92s legs gave out. Cholik caught Effirn before he could fall, overcoming his own discomfort at handling the disease-ridden child.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik knew that every eye in the clearing was upon him and the child. Doubt touched Cholik as he gazed up at the tall trees around the clearing. If the boy died along the path of the Black Road, perhaps he could hold the townspeople off long enough to get away. If he didn\'92t get away,{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint175}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint175}he was certain he\'92d be swinging by a noose from one of those branches overhead. He\'92d heard about the justice meted out by the people of Bramwell to bandits and murderers among their community.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  And Cholik intended to help them suckle a serpent to their breasts.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  At the beginning of the black ash trail, Cholik helped the boy stand on his own two feet.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What do I do?\'94 Effirn whispered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Walk,\'94 Cholik told him. \'93Follow the trail, and think about nothing but being healed.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The boy took a deep, shuddering breath, obviously rethinking his decision to follow a path so obviously filled with magic. Then, tentatively, the boy released his grip on Cholik\'92s hands. His first steps were trembling, tottering things that had Cholik\'92s breath catching at the back of his throat.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  With agonizing slowness, the boy walked. Then his steps came a little smoother, although the swaying gait he managed threatened to tear him from the path.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  No sound was made in the clearing as the audience watched the crippled boy make his way around the black ash trail. His feet kicked violet sparks from the black ash with every step he took, but it didn\'92t take long for the steps to start coming more sure, then faster. The boy\'92s shoulders straightened, and his carriage became more erect. His thin legs, then his arms, then his body swelled with increased muscle mass. No longer did his head look bulbous atop his skeletal frame.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  And when the black ash trail rose up in the air to pass over a past section, the boy stepped up into the air after it. Before, even omitting the impossibility of following such a thin line of ash into the air, the boy would not have been able to meet the challenge of the climb.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Conversations buzzed around Cholik, and he gloried in the amazement the audience had for what was taking place. While serving at the Zakarum Church, he would never have been allowed to take credit for such a spell. He turned to face the audience, moving so that he faced them all.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint176}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint176}

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Gathering himself, Cholik glanced back at the maze created by the line he\'92d cast, watching as the starting point of the line suddenly burst into violet sparks and burned rapidly.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Tentatively, Effirn started running, trying out his new muscles and abilities. He ran, and the violet fire burning up the ash trail chased him, still gaining, but by inches now rather than feet.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Effirn ran, laughing the whole way. The conversation of the audience picked up intensity.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Feeling as though he\'92d just escaped death again, Cholik held the boy to him for a moment, surprised at how big Effirn had gotten. He felt the boy\'92s arms and legs tight against him.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Released, wanting to show off his newfound strength, the boy raced across the clearing. His brothers and sisters cheered him on, and his father caught him up and pulled him into a fierce hug before handing him off to his mother.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

Almost every night, he dreamed of the cliffside in Tauruk\'92s Port, dreamed that he almost saved Mat from the skeleton\'92s clutches, from the awful thump against the cliffside that had broken Mat\'92s skull.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The tavern was a dive, another in a long string of them. They all looked alike to him. When he finished with his work, wherever he was, he ate a meal, drank until he could hardly walk, then hired a room or bedded down in a stable if the money hadn\'92t been enough to provide drink and a proper bed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The clientele was mostly fishermen, hard-faced men with callused hands and scars from nets, hooks, fish, the weather, and years of disappointment that ran bone-deep. They talked of tomorrows that sounded much better than the morning would bring, and what they would do if someday they escaped the need to climb aboard a boat every day and pray the Light was generous.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Merchants sat among the fishermen and other townspeople, discussing shipments and fortunes and the lack of protection in the northern part of the Great Ocean since Westmarch was keeping its navy so close to home these days still. There still had been no sign of the demon whom{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint183}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint183}the Westmarch sailors had seen at Tauruk\'92s Port, and many of the merchants and sailors north of Westmarch believed that the pirates had made up the story to lure the king into pulling his navy back.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Dissent grew among the northern ports and cities because they depended on Westmarch to help defend them. With the Westmarch Navy out of the way, men turned to piracy when they couldn\'92t make the sea pay any other way. Although most pirates weren\'92t acting together, their combined raiding had hurt the economies of several independent ports and even cities farther inland. Westmarch diplomacy, once a feared and treasured and expansive thing, had become weak and ineffective. Northern cities no longer curried favor with Westmarch as much.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick sopped a biscuit through the stew and popped it into his mouth. The stew was thick and oily, seasoned with grease and spices that made it cloying and hot, a meal that finished off a hardworking man\'92s day. Over the last months, he\'92d lost weight, but his fighting ability had stayed sharp. For the most part, he stayed away from the docks for fear that someone might recognize him. Although the Westmarch Navy and guardsmen hadn\'92t made a strong effort to find him, or other sailors who had intentionally jumped ship, he remained leery of possible apprehension. Some days death seemed preferable to living, but he couldn\'92t make that step. He hadn\'92t died as he\'92d grown up under his father\'92s fierce hands, and he didn\'92t intend to die willingly now.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But it was hard to live willingly.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He glanced across the room, watching Dahni as she talked and flirted with a young man. Part of him longed for the companionship of a woman, but it was only a small part. Women talked, and they dug at the things that bothered a man, most of them wanting only to help, but Darrick didn\'92t want to deal with that.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The big man sitting at the end of the bar crossed the floor to Darrick. The man was tall and broad, with a nose flattened and misshapen from fights. Scars, some freshly pink and{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint184}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint184}webbed with tiny scabs, covered his knuckles and the heels of his palms. An old knife scar showed at his throat.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Uninvited, he sat across from Darrick, his truncheon lying across his knees. \'93You\'92re working,\'94 the man said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick kept his right hand in his lap where his cutlass was. He gazed at the man. \'93I\'92m here with a friend.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  To his right, the gambler who had hired Darrick for an evening\'92s protection after they had come in on the trade caravan together praised the Light for yet another good turn. He was an older man, thin and white-haired. During an attack by bandits only yesterday, Darrick had learned that the man could handle himself and carried a number of small knives secreted on his person.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Your friend\'92s awfully lucky tonight,\'94 the big man said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93He\'92s due,\'94 Darrick said in a level voice.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The big man eyed Darrick levelly. \'93It\'92s my job to keep the peace in the tavern.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick nodded.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93If I catch your friend cheating, I\'92m throwing you both out.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick nodded again, and he hoped the gambler didn\'92t cheat or was good at it. The man had gamed with others on the caravan as they had wound their way back from Aranoch and trading with a port city that supplied the Amazon Islands.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And you might have a care when you step out of here tonight,\'94 the bouncer warned, nodding at the gambler. \'93You got a demon\'92s fog that\'92s rolled up outside that won\'92t burn off till morning. This town isn\'92t well lighted, and some folks that gamble with your friend might not take kindly to losing.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Thank you,\'94 Darrick said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Don\'92t thank me,\'94 the bouncer said. \'93I just don\'92t want either of you dying in here or anywhere near here.\'94 He stood and resumed his position at the end of the bar.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The serving wench returned with a pitcher of wine, a hopeful smile on her face.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick covered his tankard with a hand.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You\'92ve had enough?\'94 she asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93For now,\'94 he answered. \'93But I\'92ll take a bottle with me when I leave if you\'92ll have one ready.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  She nodded, hesitated, smiled briefly, then turned to walk away. The bracelet at her wrist flashed and caught Darrick\'92s eye.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Wait,\'94 Darrick whispered, his voice suddenly hoarse.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes?\'94 she asked hopefully.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick pointed at her wrist. \'93What is that bracelet you wear?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93A charm,\'94 Dahni replied. \'93It represents Dien-Ap-Sten, the Prophet of the Way of Dreams.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The bracelet was constructed of interlinked ovals separated by carved amber and rough iron so that none of the ovals touched another. The sight of it sparked memory in Darrick\'92s mind. \'93Where did you get it?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93From a trader who liked me,\'94 Dahni answered. It was a cheap attempt to make him jealous.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Who is Dien-Ap-Sten?\'94 That name didn\'92t ring a bell in Darrick\'92s memory.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93He\'92s a prophet of luck and destiny,\'94 Dahni said. \'93They\'92re building a church down in Bramwell. The man who gave me this told me that anyone who had the courage and the need to walk the Way of Dreams would get whatever his or her heart desires.\'94 She smiled at him. \'93Don\'92t you think that\'92s a bit far-fetched?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye,\'94 Darrick agreed, but the story troubled him. Bramwell wasn\'92t far from Westmarch, and that was a place he\'92d promised himself he wouldn\'92t be any time too soon.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Have you ever been there?\'94 Dahni asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye, but it was a long time ago.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Have you ever thought of returning there?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The serving wench pouted. \'93Pity.\'94 She shook her wrist, making the bracelet spin and catch the lantern light. \'93I should like to go there someday and see that church for myself. They say that when it is finished, it will be a work of art, the most beautiful thing that has ever been built.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint186}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint186}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It\'92s probably worth seeing, then,\'94 Darrick said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Dahni leaned on the table, exposing the tops of her breasts for his inspection. \'93A lot of things are worth seeing. But I know I won\'92t get to see them as long as I stay in this town. Perhaps you should think about returning to Bramwell soon.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Perhaps,\'94 Darrick said, trying not to offer any offense.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  One of the fishermen called Dahni away, raising his voice impatiently. She gave Darrick a last, lingering look, then turned in a swirl of her short skirt and walked away.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  At the next table, the gambler had another bit of good fortune, praising the Light while the other men grumbled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Pushing thoughts of the strange bracelet from his mind, Darrick returned his attention to his meal. Swearing off wine for the rest of the gambler\'92s turn at the gaming table meant the nightmares would be waiting on Darrick when he returned to his rented room. But the caravan would be in town for another day before the merchants finished their trading. He could drink until he was sure he wouldn\'92t be able to dream.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Fog rolled through the streets and made the night\'92s shadows seem darker and deeper as Darrick followed the gambler from the tavern two hours later. He tried to remember the man\'92s name but wasn\'92t surprised to find that he couldn\'92t. Life was simpler when he didn\'92t try to remember everything or everyone. On the different caravans he hired onto as a sellsword, there were people in charge, and they had a direction in which they wanted to go. Darrick went along with that.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I had a good night at the table tonight,\'94 the gambler confessed as they walked through the street. \'93As soon as I get back to my room, I\'92ll pay you what we agreed on.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye,\'94 Darrick said, though he couldn\'92t remember what amount they had agreed on. Usually it was a percentage against a small advance because a true gambler could never guarantee that he would win, and those who could were cheats and would guarantee a fight afterward.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint187}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint187}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick gazed around at the street. As the tavern bouncer had said, the town had poor lighting. Only a few lamps, staggered haphazardly and primarily centered near the more successful taverns and inns as well as the small dock lit the way. The heavy fog left a wet gleam on the cobblestones. He looked for a sign, some way of knowing where he\'92d ended on this journey, not really surprised that he didn\'92t know where he was, and not truly caring, either. Many of the towns he\'92d been to in the last few months had tended to blur into each other.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sound of the gambler\'92s in-drawn breath warned Darrick that something was wrong. He jerked his head around to the alley they\'92d just passed. Three men bolted from the alley, hurling themselves at Darrick and the gambler. Their blades gleamed even in the fog-dulled moonlight.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick drew his cutlass, dropping the jug of wine he carried under one arm. By the time the ceramic jug shattered across the poorly fit cobblestones, he had his cutlass in hand and parried a blow aimed to take off his head. Fatigued as he was, with the wine working within him, it was all Darrick could do to stay alive. He stumbled over the uneven street, never seeing the fourth man step out behind him until it was too late.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The fourth man swung a weighted shark\'92s billy that caught Darrick over his left ear and dropped him to his knees. Almost unconscious from the blow, he smashed his face against the cobblestones, and the sharp pain brought him back around. He fought to get to his knees. From there, he felt certain that he could make it to his feet. After that, perhaps he\'92d even be able to fight. Or at least earn the money the gambler had paid to protect him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Damn!\'94 one of the thieves shouted. \'93He cut me with a hide-out knife.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Warm liquid poured down the side of Darrick\'92s neck.{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint188}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint188}His vision blurred, but he saw two men taking the gambler\'92s purse.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Stop!\'94 Darrick ordered, finding his cutlass loose on the cobblestones and picking it up. He lurched toward them, lifting the blade and following it toward one of the men. Before he reached his intended target, the other man whirled around and drove a hobnailed boot into Darrick\'92s jaw. Pain blinded him as he fell again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Struggling against the blackness that waited to take him, Darrick pushed his feet, trying in vain to find purchase that would allow him to stand. He watched in helpless frustration as the men vanished back into the shadows of the alley.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Using the cutlass as a crutch to keep his feet, Darrick made his way to the gambler. Darrick peered through his tearing eyes, listening to the thundering pain inside his head, and stared at the gambler.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A bone-hilted knife jutted from the gambler\'92s chest. A crimson flower blossomed around the blade where it was sunk into flesh to the cross-guard.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The man\'92s face was filled with fear. \'93Help me, Darrick. Please. For the Light\'92s sake, I can\'92t stop the bleeding.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  From the blood on the gambler\'92s lips, Darrick knew the knife had penetrated one of his lungs as well. He pressed his hands against the gambler\'92s chest, willing the blood to stop.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick heard footsteps slap against the cobblestones just as the gambler gave a final convulsive shiver. The gambler\'92s breath locked in his throat, and his eyes stared sightlessly upward.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The silver peal of the bells in the three towers called the citizens of Bramwell to worship at the Church of Dien-Ap-Sten. Most were already inside the warren of buildings that had been erected over the last year since the caravan\'92s arrival in the city. Foundations for still more buildings had been laid, and as soon as they were completed, they would be added to the central cathedral. Beautiful statuary, crafted by some of the best artisans in Bramwell as well as other artists in Westmarch, Lut Gholein, and Kurast and beyond the Sea of Light, sat at the top of the buildings.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Buyard Cholik, called Master Sayes now, stood on one of{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint190}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint190}the rooftop gardens that decorated the church. Staring down at the intersection near the church, he watched as wagons carrying families and friends arrived. In the beginning, he remembered, the poorer families were the first to begin worship at the church. They\'92d come for the healing and in hopes of having a lifelong dream of riches or comfort answered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  And they came wishing to be chosen that day to walk on the Way of Dreams. Only a few were allowed to walk the Way of Dreams, generally only those afflicted with physical deformities or mental problems. People with arthritis and poorly mended broken limbs were nearly always admitted. Kabraxis achieved those miracles of healing with no difficulty. Every now and again, the demon rewarded someone with riches, but there was always a hidden cost none of the population could know about. As the Church of Dien-Ap-Sten had grown, so had the secrets it kept.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The church had been built high on a hill overlooking the city of Bramwell proper. Quarried from some of the best limestone in the area, which was generally shipped off to other cities while plain stone was used for the local buildings, the church gleamed in the morning light like bone laid clean from under the kiss of a knife. No one in the city could look southeast toward Westmarch and not see the church first.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The forest had been cleared on two sides of the church to accommodate the wagons and coaches that arrived during the twice-a-week services. All the believers in Bramwell came to both services, knowing the way would be made clear to the Way of Dreams where the miracles could take place.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Special, decorated boats tied up in front of the church at the newly built pilings. Boatmen in the service of the church brought captains and sailors from the ships that anchored out in the harbor. Word of the Church of Dien-Ap-Sten had started spreading across all of Westmarch, and it brought the curious as well as those seeking salvation.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint191}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint191}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  High in their towers, the three bells rang again. They would ring only once more before the service began. Cholik glanced down in front of the church and saw that, as usual, only a few would be late to the service.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik paced through the rooftop garden. Fruit trees and flowering plants, bushes, and vines occupied the rooftop, leaving a winding trail over the large building. Pausing beside a strawberry plant, Cholik stripped two succulent fruits from it, then popped them into his mouth. The berries tasted clean and fresh. No matter how many he took, there were always more.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Did you ever think it would be this big?\'94 Kabraxis asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Turning, the taste of the berries still sweet in his mouth, Cholik faced the demon.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kabraxis stood beside a trellis of tomato vines. The fruits were bright cherry red, and more tiny yellow flowers bloomed on the vines, promising an even greater harvest to come. An illusion spell, made strong by binding it to the limestone of the building, kept him from being seen by anyone below. The spell had been crafted so intricately that he didn\'92t even leave a shadow to see for anyone not meant to see him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I had hopes,\'94 Cholik answered diplomatically.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kabraxis smiled, and the effect on his demonic face was obscene. \'93You\'92re a greedy man. I like that.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik took no offense. One of the things he enjoyed about the relationship with the demon was that he had to offer no apologies for the way he felt. In the Zakarum Church, his temperament always had to be in line with accepted church doctrine.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We\'92re going to outgrow this town soon,\'94 Cholik said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You\'92re thinking of leaving?\'94 Kabraxis sounded as though he couldn\'92t believe it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Possibly. It has been in my thoughts.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You?\'94 Kabraxis scoffed. \'93Who thought only of the building of this church?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik shrugged. \'93We can build other churches.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint192}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint192}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93But this one is so big and so grand.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And the next one can be bigger and more grand.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Where would you build another church?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik hesitated, but to know the demon was to speak his mind. \'93Westmarch.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You would challenge the Zakarum Church?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik answered fiercely, \'93Yes. There are priests there whom I would see humbled and driven from the city. Or sacrificed. If that is done, and this church is positioned to look as though it can save all of Westmarch from great evil, we could convert the whole country.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You would kill those people?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Only a few of them. Enough to scare the others. The survivors will serve the church. Dead men can\'92t fear us and properly worship us.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kabraxis laughed. \'93Ah, but you\'92re a willing pupil, Buyard Cholik. Such bloodthirstiness is so refreshing to find in a human. Usually you are all so limited by your own personal desires and motivations. You want revenge on this person who wronged you or that person who has been fortunate enough to have more than you. Petty things.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A curious pride moved through Cholik. Over the year and some months of their acquaintance, he had changed. He hadn\'92t been lured over to the Darkness as so many priests he\'92d known had feared for those they sought to save. Rather, he\'92d reached inside himself and brought it all forward.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The Zakarum Church taught that man was of two minds as well, constantly fighting an inner war between the Light and the Darkness.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93But my plan to move into Westmarch is a good one?\'94 Cholik asked. He knew he was currying the demon\'92s favor, but Kabraxis liked to give it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes,\'94 the demon answered, \'93but it is not yet time. Already, this church has earned enmity from the Zakarum Church. Gaining the king\'92s permission to build a church within the city would be hard. The tenets between the king{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint193}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint193}and the church are too tight. And you forget: Westmarch still seeks the demon that was seen with the pirates. If we move too quickly, we will draw more suspicion.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It has been more than a year,\'94 Cholik protested.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The king and the people have not forgotten,\'94 Kabraxis said. \'93Diablo has left his mark upon them after the subterfuge he ran at Tristram. We must first win their trust, then betray them.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93How?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I have a plan.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik waited. One thing he\'92d learned that Kabraxis didn\'92t like was being questioned too closely.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93In time,\'94 Kabraxis said. \'93We have to raise an army of believers before then, warriors who will go and kill anyone who stands in their way to bringing the truth to the world.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93An army to oppose Westmarch?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93An army to oppose the Zakarum Church,\'94 Kabraxis said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93There are not enough people in all of Bramwell.\'94 The thought staggered Cholik. Images of battlefields painted red with the blood of men flashed through his mind. And he knew those images were probably much less horrific than the actual battles would be.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We will raise the army from within Westmarch,\'94 Kabraxis said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93How?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We will turn the king against the Zakarum Church,\'94 the demon replied. \'93And once we make him see how unholy the Zakarum Church has become, he will create that army.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And the Zakarum Church will be razed to the ground.\'94 Warmth surged through Cholik as he entertained the idea of it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93How will you turn the king?\'94 Cholik asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kabraxis gestured toward the church. \'93In time, Buyard Cholik. Everything will be revealed to you in time. Diablo{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint194}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint194}returned to this world only a short time ago by corrupting the Soulstone that bound him. He unleashed his power in Tristram, taking over King Leoric\'92s son, Prince Albrecht. As you will remember, for you were privy to the machinations of the Zakarum Church at the time, Tristram and Westmarch almost warred. The human adventurers who fought Diablo thought they destroyed him, but Diablo used one of his enemies as the new vessel in which to get around these lands. As we plan for conquest and success, so Diablo plans. But demons must be cunning and crafty, as we are being now. If we grow too quickly, we will attract the attention of the Prime Evils, and I\'92m unwilling to deal with them at the moment. For now, though, you have a service to give. I promise you a miracle today that will bring even more converts.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik nodded, stilling the questions that flooded into his brain. \'93Of course. By your leave.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Go with Dien-Ap-Sten\'92s blessings,\'94 Kabraxis said, intoning the words that they had made legendary throughout Bramwell and beyond. \'93May the Way of Dreams take you where you want to go.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 The service passed with liquid ease.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Standing in the shadowed balcony that overlooked the parishioners, Buyard Cholik watched as the crowd fidgeted and waited through the singing and the addresses of the young priests speaking of Dien-Ap-Sten\'92s desires for each and every man, woman, and child in the world of men to rise and succeed to their just rewards. The young priests stood on the small stage below Cholik\'92s balcony. Mostly, though, the young priests\'92 messages intoned the virtues of serving the Prophet of the Light and sharing profits with the church so that more good work could be done.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But they were all truly waiting on the Call to the Way of Dreams.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  After the last of the priests finished his message and the final songs were sung, songs that Kabraxis had written himself, which echoed of drumbeats like a hammering heart and melodic pipes that sounded like blood rushing through a man\'92s ears, a dozen acolytes stepped up from the pit in front of the small stage with lighted torches in their hands.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The drums hammered, creating an eerie crescendo that resounded among the rafters of the high-vaulted ceiling. Cymbals crashed as the pipes played.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Frenzy built within the crowd. There still, Cholik saw, were not enough seats in the church. They\'92d just opened the upper floor of the church three weeks ago, and the membership had more than filled the cathedral again. Many of the worshippers were from other cities up and{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint196}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint196}down the coastline, and a number of them were from Westmarch. They made pilgrimages from the other cities by hired caravan or by paying ship\'92s passage.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Some ships\'92 captains and caravan masters made small fortunes out of operating twice-weekly round-trips to Bramwell. Many people were willing to pay passage for the chance to walk the Way of Dreams, for health reasons or in hopes of gaining their heart\'92s desire.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Once Cholik had discovered the startup of the lucrative business, he\'92d sent word to the captains and caravan masters that they would be expected to bring offerings in the way of building materials for the church with each trip. Only two ships had gone down and one caravan was destroyed by a horde of skeletons and zombies before the tribute asked of them started getting delivered on a regular basis. More caravans were starting up from Lut Gholein and other countries to the east.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The crowd shouted, \'93Way of Dreams! Way of Dreams!\'94 Their manner would not have been permitted in the Zakarum Church, and they bordered on the fringe of becoming an unruly crowd.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Guards Cholik had chosen from the warriors who believed in Dien-Ap-Sten lined the cathedral walls and stood in small raised towers in the midst of the congregation. For the most part, the guards carried cudgels that bore the elliptical rings that were Kabraxis\'92s sign cleverly worked into the wire-bound hilt. Other guards carried crossbows that had been magically enchanted by mystic gems. The guards dressed in black chainmail with stylized silver icons of the elliptical rings on their chests. All of them were hard men, warriors who had ventured down the Black Road, as the Way of Dreams was called by initiates, and had been imbued with greater strength and speed than normal men.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The dozen acolytes touched their torches to different spots on the wall that held the stage and Cholik\'92s balcony. Cholik watched as the flames leapt up the whale-oil-fed channels and came straight up to him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint197}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint197}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The flames, aided by a ward that was laid upon the wall, raced around Cholik and lifted the balcony and the design from the wall, exposing the flaming face of the cowled snake that had been designed by black stones intermixed with white. The flames danced along the black stones and lit in the pits of the snake\'92s eyes.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The audience quieted waiting expectantly to see what would occur. But Cholik sensed the violence in the room that was on the cusp of breaking out. The guards moved at their posts, reminding everyone they were there.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I am Master Sayes,\'94 Cholik said into the sudden silence that filled the cathedral. \'93I am the Wayfinder, designated so by the hand of Dien-Ap-Sten, Prophet of the Light.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Polite applause followed Cholik\'92s words as it was supposed to, but the expectant air never left the room. Believers though they were, the people waited like jackals at a feast, knowing that as soon as the larger predators left the area, they would have what was left.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik scattered powder around him that ignited in great gouts of green, red, violet, and blue flames that stopped short of the closest parishioners. The scents of honeysuckle, cinnamon, and lavender filled the cathedral. He spoke, unleashing the spell that held the gateway to the wall.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  In response to the spell, the flaming cowled snake\'92s head lunged from the wall, hanging out over the crowd and opening its mouth. Cholik rode the balcony that stood out over the snake\'92s eyes. The snake\'92s mouth was the entrance to the Black Road, leading to the gateway where a black marble trail wound over and under and through itself, winding around to bring the traveler back to the snake\'92s mouth bearing the gifts Kabraxis had seen fit to bestow.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93May the Way of Dreams take you where you want to go,\'94 Cholik said.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Beneath the hood of his robe, Cholik smiled. It felt so right to be in charge of all this, to be so powerful. \'93Now,\'94 he said, knowing they hung on his every word, \'93who among you is worthy?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  It was a challenge, and Cholik knew it, reveled in the knowledge.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The group went wild, screaming and yelling, announcing their needs and wants and desires. The crowd became a living, feral thing, on the brink of lashing out at itself. People had died within the church, victims of their friends and neighbors and strangers over the past year, and the limestone floor had drunk down their blood, putting down crystal roots into the ground beneath that Kabraxis had one day shown Cholik. The roots looked like cones of weeping blood rubies, never quite solid and seeming to ooze into the earth more with every drop that was received.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Undulating, taking Cholik with it, the fiery snake head reached out over the crowd, over the first tier of people, then over the second. People held their ill and diseased children above them, calling out to Dien-Ap-Sten to bless them with a cure. The wealthier people among the audience hired tall warriors to hold them on their shoulders, putting them that much closer to the entrance to the Black Road.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The snake\'92s tongue flicked out, a black ribbon of translucent obsidian that was as fluid as water, and the choice was made.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik gazed at the child who had been held up by his father, seeing that it wasn\'92t one child but two somehow grown together. The children possessed only two arms and two legs attached to two heads and a body and a half. They looked no more than three years of age.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93An abomination,\'94 a man in the audience cried out.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Demon born,\'94 still another said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The dozen acolytes with the torches raced forward, aided by the guards till they reached the chosen one.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint199}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint199}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  There has to be some mistake,\plain \f2\fs24 Cholik thought as he stared at the afflicted children knitted together of their own flesh and bone. He couldn\'92t help feeling that Kabraxis had betrayed him, though he could think of no reason the demon would do that.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Children so severely deformed usually died during childbirth, as did the women who bore them. Their fathers put the children who didn\'92t die to death, or it was done by the priests. Cholik had executed such children himself, then buried them in consecrated earth in the Zakarum Church. Other deformed children\'92s bodies were sold to mages, sages, and black marketers who trafficked in demonic goods.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The acolytes surrounded the father and the conjoined children, filling the area with light. The chainmail-clad guards shoved the crowd back from the father, making more room.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik looked at the man and had to force himself to speak. \'93Will your sons follow the Black Road, then?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Tears ran down the father\'92s face. \'93My sons can\'92t walk, Wayfinder Sayes.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93They must,\'94 Cholik said, thinking that was perhaps the way to break the moment. Some who wanted to walk the Black Road gave in to their own fears at the last minute and did not go. The chance to walk the Black Road was never offered again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Unbidden, the snake\'92s obsidian tongue flicked out and coiled around the twin boys. Without apparent effort, the snake pulled the boys into its fanged mouth. They screamed as they approached the curtain of flames that hugged the huge head.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Standing on the platform over the ridge of the snake\'92s heavy brow and peering through the fire, Cholik only saw the two boys disappear beneath him and couldn\'92t see them anymore. He waited, uncertain what would happen, afraid that he was about to lose all that he had invested in.

Mikel and Dannis passed so close to the flames that light the snake\'92s face\'97she knew they didn\'92t actually have faces because her father told her that, and her older brothers made fun of her when she mentioned it\'97that she felt certain they were going to be cooked.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Her uncle Ramais always told stories about children getting cooked and eaten by demons. And sometimes those children were baked into pies. She always tried to figure out how a child pie would look, but whenever she asked her mother, her mother would always tell her she needed to stay away from her uncle and his terrible stories. But Uncle Ramais was a sailor for the Westmarch Navy and always had the best stories. She was old enough that she knew she couldn\'92t believe all of her uncle\'92s stories, but it was still fun making believe that she did.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Meridor really didn\'92t want her younger brothers baked or broiled or burned in any manner. At nine years of age and the youngest girl in a household of eight children, she was the one who watched and cleaned Mikel and Dannis the most. Some days she got tired of them because they were always cranky and uncomfortable. Da said it was because each of her brothers was a tight fit living in one body. Sometimes Meridor wondered if Mikel\'92s and Dannis\'92s other arms and legs were somehow tucked up into the body they shared.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  She watched, staring at the stone snake head as it gulped her brothers down. Since no one was listening to her, she prayed the way she\'92d been taught to in the small Zakarum Church. She felt guilty because her da had told her that the new prophet was the only chance her brothers had of living. They were getting sicker these days, and they were more aware that they weren\'92t like anybody else and couldn\'92t walk or move the way they wanted to. She thought it must be pretty horrible. They couldn\'92t be happy with each other or anyone else.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Way of Dreams! Way of Dreams!\'94 the people around her yelled, shaking their fists in the air.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The yelling always made Meridor uncomfortable. The people always sounded so angry and so frightened. Da had always told her that the people weren\'92t that way; it was just that they were all so hopeful. Meridor couldn\'92t understand why anyone would want to walk down into the stone snake\'92s belly. But that was where the Way of Dreams was, and the Way of Dreams\'97according to Da\'97could accomplish all kinds of miracles. She had seen a few of them over the past year, but they hadn\'92t mattered much. No one she knew had ever been chosen by Dien-Ap-Sten.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  On some evenings, when the family gathered around their modest table, everyone talked about what they would wish for if they had the chance to walk the Way of Dreams. Meridor hadn\'92t added much to the conversation at those times because she didn\'92t know what she wanted to be when she grew up.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lying on the snake\'92s tongue, Meridor\'92s brothers wailed and screamed. She saw their tiny faces, tears glittering like diamonds on their cheeks as they screamed and wept.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Meridor looked up at her mother. \'93Ma.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Shhh,\'94 her mother responded, knotting her fists in the fancy dress she\'92d made to go to the Church of the Prophet of the Light. She\'92d never worn anything like that to the Zakarum Church, and she\'92d always said that being poor wasn\'92t a bad thing in the eyes of the church. But Da and Ma both insisted that everybody be freshly bathed and clean both nights a week that they went to the new church.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Scared and nervous, Meridor fell silent and didn\'92t talk. She watched as Mikel and Dannis rolled in the snake\'92s mouth toward the Way of Dreams housed in its gullet. Over the months of their visits to the church, she had seen people walk into the snake\'92s mouth, then walk back out again, healed and whole. But how could even Dien-Ap-Sten heal her brothers?
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The snake\'92s mouth closed. Above it on the platform over the snake\'92s fiery eyes, Master Sayes led the church in{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint202}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint202}prayer. The screams of the two little boys echoed through the cathedral. Knotting her fists and pressing them against her chin as she listened to the horrid screams, Meridor backed away and bumped into the man standing beside her.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  She turned at once to apologize because many adults in the church were short-tempered with children. Children got chosen a lot by Dien-Ap-Sten for healing and miracles, and most of the adults didn\'92t feel they deserved it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92m sorry,\'94 Meridor said, looking up. She froze when she saw the monstrous face above her.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The man was tall and big, but that was somewhat hidden beneath the simple woolen traveling cloak he wore. His clothing was old and patched, showing signs of hard usage and covered over with road dust and grit. The frayed kerchief at his neck was tied by a sailor\'92s knot that Uncle Ramais had showed her. The man stood like a shadow carved out of the crowd.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But the most horrible thing about him was his face. It was blackened from burning, the skin crisp and ridged as it had pulled together from the heat. Fine, thin cracks showed in the burned areas, and flecks of blood ran down his face like sweat. Most of the damage was on the left side of his face and looked like an eclipse of the moon. There had been one of those the night Mikel and Dannis had been born.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It\'92s all right, girl,\'94 the man said in a hoarse voice.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Does it hurt?\'94 Meridor asked. Then she clapped a hand over her mouth when she remembered that many adults didn\'92t like being asked questions, especially about things they probably didn\'92t want to talk about.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A small smile formed on the man\'92s cracked and blistered mouth. New blood flecks appeared on his burned cheek, and pain shone in his eyes. \'93All the time,\'94 he answered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Are you here hoping to get healed?\'94 Meridor asked, since he seemed to be open to questions.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No.\'94 The man shook his head, and the movement{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint203}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint203}caused the hood of his traveling cloak to shift, baring his head a little and revealing the gnarled stubble of burned hair that poked through the blackened skin.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Then why are you here?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I came to see this Way of Dreams that I had heard so much about.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It\'92s been here a long time. Have you been here before?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Why not?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The burned man glanced down at her. \'93You\'92re a curious child.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes. I\'92m sorry. It\'92s none of my business.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No, it\'92s not.\'94 The man stared at the stone snake as the drums boomed, the cymbals clashed, and the pipes continued their writhing melodies. \'93Those were your brothers?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes. Mikel and Dannis. They\'92re conjoined.\'94 Meridor stumbled over the word a little. It just didn\'92t sound right. Even after all the years of having to tell other people about her brothers, she still couldn\'92t say it right all the time.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Do you believe they\'92re abominations?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No.\'94 Meridor sighed. \'93They\'92re just unhappy and in pain.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The boys\'92 screams tore through the cathedral again. Atop the stone snake, Master Sayes showed no sign of stopping the ritual.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93They sound like they\'92re in pain now.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes.\'94 Meridor worried about her brothers as she always did when they were out of her sight. She spent so much time taking care of them, how could she not be worried?
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You\'92ve seen others healed?\'94 the burned man asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes. Lots.\'94 Meridor watched the undulations of the stone snake. Were Mikel and Dannis walking the Way of Dreams now? Or were they just trapped inside the snake while truly terrible things happened to them?
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What have you seen?\'94 the man asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ve seen the crippled made whole, the blind made to see, and all kinds of diseases healed.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint204}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint204}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I was told that Dien-Ap-Sten usually picks children to heal.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Meridor nodded.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93A lot of adults don\'92t like that,\'94 the burned man said. \'93I heard them talking in the taverns in town and on the ship that brought me here.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Meridor nodded again. She had seen people get into fights in Bramwell while discussing such things. She was determined not to argue or point out that there were a lot of sick kids in the city.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Why do you think Dien-Ap-Sten picks children most of the time?\'94 the burned man asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I don\'92t know.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The burned man grinned as he watched the stone snake. Blood wept from his upper lip and threaded through his white teeth and over the blistered flesh of his pink lips. \'93Because they are impressionable and because they can believe more than an adult, girl. Show an adult a miracle, and he or she will reach for logical conclusions for why it happened. But the heart of a child . . . by the Light, you can win the heart of a child forever.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Meridor didn\'92t completely understand what the man was talking about, but she didn\'92t let it bother her. She\'92d already discovered that there were things about adults that she didn\'92t understand, and things about adults that she wasn\'92t meant to understand, and things that she understood but wasn\'92t supposed to act as if she understood.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Abruptly, Master Sayes ordered silence in the cathedral. The musical instruments stopped playing at once, and the hoarse shouts of the crowd died away.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Once when she had been there, Meridor remembered, a group of rowdy men hadn\'92t stopped making noise as Master Sayes had ordered. They\'92d been drunk and argumentative, and they had said bad things about the church. Master Sayes\'92s warriors had forced their way through the crowd, sought them out, and killed them. Some said that they had killed two innocent men as well, but people stopped talking about that by the next meeting.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint205}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint205}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Silence echoed in the massive cathedral and made Meridor feel smaller than ever. She clasped her hands and fretted over Mikel and Dannis. Would the Way of Dreams simply tear off one of their heads, killing one of them to make a whole child out of what was left? That was a truly horrible thought, and Meridor wished it would leave her mind. But it would have been even worse, she supposed, if Dien-Ap-Sten had asked her da or ma to decide which child lived and which child died.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then the power filled the cathedral.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Meridor recognized it from the other times she had experienced it. It vibrated through her body, shaking even the teeth in her head, and it made her all mixed up and somehow excited inside.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The burned man lifted his arm, the one with the hand that was completely blackened by whatever had cooked him. Crimson threads crisscrossed the cooked flesh as he worked his fingers. Flesh split open over one knuckle, revealing the pink flesh and the white bone beneath.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But as Meridor watched, the hand started to heal. Scabs formed over the breaks, then flaked away to reveal whole flesh again. However, the new flesh was still crisp, burned black. She glanced up at the burned man and saw that even the cracks in his face had healed somewhat.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taking down his hand, the burned man gazed at it as if surprised. \'93By the Light,\'94 he whispered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Dien-Ap-Sten can heal you,\'94 Meridor said. It felt good to offer the man hope. Da always said hope was the best thing a man could wish for when dealing with fate and bad luck. \'93You should start coming to church here. Perhaps one day the snake will pick you.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The burned man smiled and shook his head beneath the hood of his traveling cloak. \'93I would not be allowed to seek healing here, girl.\'94 Crimson leaked down his cracked face again. \'93In fact, I\'92m surprised that I wasn\'92t killed outright when I tried to enter this building.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  That sounded strange. Meridor had never heard anyone speak like that.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint206}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint206}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  With a sigh that sounded like a bellows blast she\'92d heard at the blacksmith\'92s shop, the snake\'92s huge lower jaw dropped open. Smoke and embers belched from the snake\'92s belly.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Meridor stood on her tiptoes, waiting anxiously. When Mikel and Dannis had entered the snake, she\'92d never thought that she might not see them again. Or even that she might not see one of them again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A boy stepped through the opening of the snake\'92s mouth on two good legs. He gazed out at the crowd fearfully, trying in vain to hide.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Dannis!\plain \f2\fs24 Meridor\'92s heart leapt with happiness, but it plunged in the next moment when she realized that Mikel, little Mikel who loved her sock puppet shows, was gone. Before her first tears had time to leave her eyes or do more than blur her vision, she saw her other little brother step out from behind Dannis.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Mikel! They both live!

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Da whooped with joy, and Ma cried out, praising Dien-Ap-Sten for all to hear. The crowd burst loose with their joy and excitement, but Meridor couldn\'92t help thinking that it was because having Mikel and Dannis returned meant that another would soon be selected to journey down the Way of Dreams.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Da rushed forward and took her brothers from the fiery maw of the stone snake. Even as he pulled them into an embrace, joined by Ma, movement at Meridor\'92s side drew her attention to the burned man.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  She watched as everything seemed to slow down, and she could hear her heartbeat thunder in her ears. The burned man whipped his traveling cloak back to reveal the hand crossbow he held there. The curved bow rested on a frame no longer than Meridor\'92s forearm. He brought the small weapon up in his good hand, extended it, and squeezed the trigger. The quarrel leapt from the crossbow\'92s grooved track and sped across the cathedral.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Tracking the quarrel\'92s flight, Meridor saw the fletched shaft take Master Sayes high in the chest and knock him{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint207}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint207}backward. The Wayfinder plunged from the snake\'92s neck, disappearing from sight. Screams split the cathedral as Meridor\'92s senses sped up again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Someone has killed Master Sayes!\'94 a man\'92s voice yelled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Find him!\'94 another yelled. \'93Find that damned assassin!\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It came from over there!\'94 a man yelled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  In disbelief, Meridor stood frozen as cathedral guards and robed acolytes plunged into the crowd brandishing weapons and torches. She turned to look for the burned man, only to find him gone. He\'92d taken his leave during the confusion, probably brushing by people who were only now realizing what he had done.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Altough the cathedral guards worked quickly, there were too many people inside the building to organize a pursuit. But one man fleeing through people determined to get out of the way of the menacing guards moved rapidly. She never saw him escape.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  One of the acolytes stopped beside Meridor. The acolyte held his torch high and shoved people away, revealing the abandoned hand crossbow on the floor.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Here!\'94 the acolyte yelled. \'93The weapon is here.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Guards rushed over to join him.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Who saw this man?\'94 a burly guard demanded.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Da strode forward to protect her, she knew that he did, but one of the guards swung his sword hilt into her da\'92s stomach and dropped him to his knees.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Meridor knew the men were afraid as well as angry.{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint208}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint208}Perhaps Dien-Ap-Sten would take vengeance against them for allowing something terrible to happen to Master Sayes.

He was sixty if he was a day, lean and whipcord tough, with a cottony white beard and his hair pulled back into a ponytail. Shell earrings hung from both ears. Scars showed on his face and hands and arms. He wore tarred breeches and a shirt to stand against the spray that carried across the still-primitive harbor.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Darrick sat on a crate that was part of the cargo he\'92d been hired to help transport from the caravel out in the bay to the warehouse on the shoreline of Seeker\'92s Point. It was the first good paying work he\'92d had in three days, and he\'92d begun to think he was going to have to crew out on a ship to keep meals coming and a roof over his head. Shipping out wasn\'92t something he looked forward to. The sea held too many memories. He reached into the worn leather bag he carried and took out a piece of cheddar cheese and two apples.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I have trouble believing the part about the stone snake gulping people down, I do,\'94 Darrick admitted. He used his small belt knife to cut wedges from the half-circle of cheese and to cut the apples into quarters, expertly slicing the cores away. He gave Sahyir one of the cheese wedges and one of the sliced apples. Tossing the apple cores over the side of the barge attracted the small perch that lived along the harbor and fed on refuse from the ships, warehouses, and street sewers. They kissed the top of the water with hungry mouths.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I seen it, Darrick,\'94 the old man insisted. \'93Seen a man that couldn\'92t use his legs pull himself into that snake\'92s gullet,{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint210}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint210}an\'92 then come up an\'92 walk outta there on his own two legs again.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick chewed a piece of cheese as he shook his head. \'93Healers can do that. Potions can do that.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93But those all come for a price,\'94 Sahyir argued. \'93Healers an\'92 potions an\'92 enchanted weapons, why, they\'92re all well an\'92 good for a man what\'92s got the gold or the strength to get \'92em. And churches? Don\'92t get me started. Churches dote on them that put big donations in the coffers, or them what\'92s got the king\'92s favor.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Gazing across the sea, feeling the wind rush through his hair and against his face, the chill of it biting into his flesh in spite of his own tarred clothing, Darrick looked at the small village that clung tenaciously to the rocky land of the cove. \'93We take care of ourselves,\'94 he said. \'93Just like we always have.\'94 He and the old man had been friends for months, sharing an easy companionship.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Seeker\'92s Point was a small town just south of the barbarian tribes\'92 territories. In the past, the village had been a supply fort for traders, whalers, and seal hunters who had trekked through the frozen north. Little more than a hundred years ago, a merchant house had posted an army there meant to chase off the marauding barbarian pirates who hunted the area without fear of the Westmarch Navy. A bounty had been placed on the heads of the barbarians, and for a time the mercenary army had collected from the trading house.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then some of the barbarian tribes had united and laid siege to the village. The trading house hadn\'92t been able to resupply or ship the mercenaries out. During the course of one winter, the mercenaries and all those who had lived{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint211}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint211}with them had been killed to the last person. It had taken more than forty years for a few fur traders to reestablish themselves in the area, and only then because they traded favorably with the barbarians and brought them goods they couldn\'92t get on their own with any dependability.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Houses and buildings dotted the steep mountains that surrounded the cove. Pockets of unimproved land and forest stood tall and proud between some of the houses and buildings. The village slowly eroded those patches, though, taking the timber for buildings and for heat, but baring several of those places only revealed the jagged, gap-toothed, rocky soil beneath. Nothing could be built in those places.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Why didn\'92t you stay in Bramwell?\'94 Darrick asked. He bit into the apple, finding it sweet and tart.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Sahyir waved the thought away. \'93Why, even before they up an\'92 had all this religious business success, Bramwell wasn\'92t for the likes of me.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Snorting, Sahyir said, \'93Why, it\'92s too busy there is why. A man gets to wanderin\'92 around them streets\'97all in a tizzy and a bother\'97an\'92 he\'92s like to meet hisself comin\'92 and goin\'92.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Despite the melancholy mood that usually stayed with him, Darrick smiled. Bramwell was a lot larger than Seeker\'92s Point, but it paled in comparison with Westmarch. \'93You\'92ve never been to Westmarch, have you?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Once,\'94 Sahyir answered. \'93Only once. I made a mistake of signing on with a cargo freighter needin\'92 a hand. I was a young strappin\'92 pup like yerself, thought I wasn\'92t afeard of nothin\'92. So I signed on. Got to Westmarch harbor and looked out over that hell-spawned place.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I meant no offense,\'94 Darrick said. \'93It\'92s just that after making that trip down to Westmarch and through the bad weather that usually marks the gulf, I can\'92t imagine anyone not leaving the ship when they had a chance.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Only far enough to buy a wineskin from the local tavern and get a change of victuals from time to time,\'94 Sahyir said. \'93But the only reason I brought up Bramwell today was because I was talkin\'92 to a man I met last night, an\'92 I thought ye might be interested in what he had to say.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick watched the other barges plying the harbor. Today was a busy day for Seeker\'92s Point. Longshoremen usually had two jobs in the village because there wasn\'92t enough work handling cargo to provide for a family. Even men who didn\'92t take on crafts and artisan work hunted or fished or trapped when finances ran low. Sometimes they migrated for a time to other cities farther south along the coast like Bramwell.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Interested in what?\'94 Darrick asked.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Them symbols I see ye a-drawin\'92 and a-sketchin\'92 now an\'92 again.\'94 Sahyir brought up a water flask and handed it to Darrick.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick drank, tasting the metallic flavor of the water. There were a few mines in the area as well, but none of them was profitable enough to cause a merchant to invest in developing and risk losing everything to the barbarians.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I know ye don\'92t like talkin\'92 about them symbols,\'94 Sahyir said, \'93an\'92 I apologize for talkin\'92 about \'92em when it ain\'92t no business of me own. But I see ye a-frettin\'92 an\'92 aworryin\'92 about \'92em, an\'92 I know it troubles ye some.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  During the time he had known the old man, Darrick had never mentioned where he\'92d learned about the elliptical design with the line that threaded through it. He\'92d tried to put all that in the past. A year ago, when the gambler had died while under his protection, Darrick had lost himself to work and drink, barely getting by. Guilt ate at him over{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint213}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint213}losing Mat and the gambler. And the phantasm of his father back in the barn in Hillsfar had lived with him every day.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick didn\'92t even remember arriving in Seeker\'92s Point, had been so drunk that the ship\'92s captain had thrown him off the ship and refused to let him back on. Sahyir had found Darrick at the water\'92s edge, sick and feverish. The old man had gotten help from a couple of friends and taken Darrick back to his shanty up in the hills overlooking the village. He\'92d cared for Darrick, nursing him back to health during the course of a month. It had been a time, the old man had said, when he\'92d been certain on more than one occasion he was going to lose Darrick to the sickness or to the guilt that haunted him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Even now, Darrick didn\'92t know how much of his story he\'92d told Sahyir, but the old man had told him that he\'92d drawn the symbol constantly. Darrick couldn\'92t remember doing that, but Sahyir had produced scraps of paper with the design on it that Darrick had been forced to assume were in his own hand.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Buyard Cholik lay supine on a bed in the back room of the Church of the Prophet of the Light and knew that he was dying. His breath rattled and heaved in his chest, and his lungs filled with his own blood. Try as he might, he could not see the face of the man\'97or woman\'97who had so gravely wounded him.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  In the beginning, the pain from the arrow embedded in his chest had felt as if a red-hot poker had been shoved into him. When the pain had begun to subside, he\'92d mistakenly believed it was because he hadn\'92t been as badly hurt as he\'92d at first feared. Then he\'92d realized that he wasn\'92t getting better; the pain was going away because he was dying. Death closing in on him robbed him of his senses.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He silently damned the Zakarum Church and the Light he\'92d grown to love and fear as a child. Wherever they were, he was certain that they were laughing at him now. Here he was, his youth returned to him, stricken down by an unknown assassin. He damned the Light for abandoning him to old age when it could have killed him young{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint216}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint216}before fear of getting infirm and senile had settled in, and he damned it for letting him be weak enough to allow his fear to force him to seek a bargain with Kabraxis. The Light had driven him into the demon\'92s arms, and he\'92d been betrayed again.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik had believed the demon would let him die. After all, there were plenty of other priests and even acolytes who could step into the brief void that Cholik felt he would leave in his passing.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik drew a wheezing breath. Fear rushed through him, winding hard and coarse as a dry-mouthed lizard\'92s tongue. He had less room to breathe now than he had during his last breath. His lungs were filling up with his blood, but there was hardly any pain.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Coughing, gasping, Cholik forced open his heavy eyelids. The tall ceiling of his private rooms remained blurred and indistinct. Blackness ate at the edges of his vision, steadily creeping inward, and he knew if it continued it would consume him.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Priests attended Cholik, putting compresses on the wound in his chest. The crossbow quarrel jutted out, the shaft and feathers speckled with his blood. Acolytes stood in the background while mercenaries guarded the doorway. The room was decorated with the finest silks and hand-carved furniture. An embroidered rug from the Kurast markets covered the center of the stone floor.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik opened his mouth to speak and only made a hoarse croaking noise. His breath sprayed fine crimson droplets.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What is it, Master Sayes?\'94 the priest beside Cholik\'92s bed asked.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Out,\'94 Cholik gasped. \'93Get out! Now!\'94 The effort to speak nearly drained him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93But, master,\'94 the priest protested. \'93Your wounds\'97\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Out, I said.\'94 Cholik tried to rise and was surprised that he somehow found the strength.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  I am with you,\plain \f2\fs24 Kabraxis said, and Cholik felt a little stronger.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The priests and acolytes drew back as if watching the dead return to life. Perplexity and maybe a little relief showed on the faces of the mercenaries. A dead employer meant possibly some blame in the matter, and definitely no more gold.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Go,\'94 Cholik wheezed. \'93\plain \f2\i\fs24 Now. Now\plain \f2\fs24 , damn you all, or I\'92ll see to it that you\'92re lost in one of the hell pits that surround the Black Road.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The priests turned and ordered the acolytes and the mercenaries from the room. They closed the massive oaken double doors, shutting him off from the hallway.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Standing beside the bed where he\'92d lain hovering between life and death, Cholik gripped a small stand that held a delicate glass vase that had been blown in the hands of a master. Flowers and butterflies hung trapped in death inside the glass walls of the vase, preserved by some small magic that had not allowed them to burn while the molten glass had been formed and cooled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The secret door hidden at the back of the chamber opened, turning on hinges so that the section of wall twisted to reveal the large tunnel behind it. The church was honeycombed with such tunnels to make it easier for the demon to get around inside the buildings. Even as tall as the ceiling was, the demon\'92s horns almost scraped it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Hurry,\'94 Cholik gasped. The room blurred further still, then abruptly seemed to spin around him. Only a moment of dizziness touched him, but he saw the rug on the floor coming up at him and knew he was falling although there was no sensation of doing so.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Before Cholik hit the floor, Kabraxis caught him in his huge, three-fingered hands.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint218}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint218}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You will not die,\'94 the demon said, but his words took on more the aspect of a command. \'93We are not done yet, you and I.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Even though the demon was in his face, Cholik barely heard the words. His hearing was failing him now. His heart had slowed within his chest, no longer able to struggle against his blood-filled lungs. He tried to take a breath, but there was no room. Panic set in, but it was only a distant drumbeat at his temples, no longer able to touch him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Kabraxis stated, gripping Cholik by the shoulders.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A bolt of fire coursed through Cholik\'92s body. It ignited at the base of his spine, then raced up to the bottom of his skull and exploded behind his eyes. He went blind for a moment, but it was white light instead of darkness that filled his vision. He felt the pain of the quarrel as it was ripped from his chest. The agony almost pushed him over the edge of consciousness.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Breathe,\'94 Kabraxis said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik couldn\'92t. He thought perhaps he didn\'92t remember how or that he lacked the strength. Either way, no air entered his lungs. The world outside his body no longer mattered; everything felt cottony and distant.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then renewed pain forked through his chest, following the path the quarrel had made and spiking into his lungs. Gripped by the pain, Cholik instinctively took a breath. Air filled his lungs\'97now empty of blood\'97and with each heaving breath he took, the incredible iron bands of pain released their hold on him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kabraxis guided him to the edge of the bed. Cholik only then realized that his blood smeared the bed coverings. He gasped, drinking down air as the room steadied around him. Anger settled into him then, and he glanced up at the demon.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Did you know about the assassin?\'94 Cholik demanded. He imagined that Kabraxis had let the assassin shoot him only to remind Cholik how much he was needed.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No.\'94 Kabraxis crossed his arms over his huge chest. Muscles rippled in his forearms and shoulders.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I was also making your miracle happen at the time of your attack,\'94 Kabraxis said. \'93I made two whole boys from the conjoined twins, and that was no easy feat.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You couldn\'92t save me from that arrow?\'94 Assessing the demon\'92s abilities and powers had been out of Cholik\'92s reach. Did the Black Road consume Kabraxis so much that it left him weak? That knowledge might be important. But it was also frightening to realize that the demon was limited and fallible after Cholik had tied his destiny to Kabraxis.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I trusted the mercenaries hired with the gold that I have made available to you to save you from something like this,\'94 Kabraxis answered.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Don\'92t make that mistake again,\'94 Cholik snapped.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Deliberately, Kabraxis twisted the bloody quarrel in his hands. Lines in his harsh face deepened. \'93Never make the mistake of assuming you are my equal, Buyard Cholik. Familiarity breeds contempt, but it also pushes you toward sudden death.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Watching the demon, Cholik realized that Kabraxis could just as easily thrust the bolt through his chest again. Only this time the demon could pierce his heart. He swallowed, hardly able to get around the thick lump in his throat. \'93Of course. Forgive me. I forgot myself in the heat of the moment.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kabraxis nodded, dipping his horns, almost scratching the ceiling.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The thought that the crowd had lamented his apparent death filled Cholik with smugness. He liked the way the people of Bramwell curried favor with him when he passed through the city\'92s streets, and he liked the desperate envy he saw in their eyes regarding his place in the worship of their new prophet.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik stepped toward the man. The priests and the other mercenaries moved back, as if expecting Cholik to summon down a lightning bolt to reduce the mercenary leader to ash. The thought, Cholik had to admit, was tempting. He looked away from the quaking mercenary and at the girl. The resemblance between the girl and the conjoined twins was striking.

One man had escaped that night, a Westmarch sailor who had even evaded the skeletons and zombies Kabraxis had raised to kill everyone there.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik felt that no one in Bramwell would have dared attack him in the church. And if the man were burned as badly as the girl described, someone would have come forward to identify him and hope to earn a reward from Dien-Ap-Sten or himself.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

Pipe smoke and the closing night filled the tavern with darkness. Men swapping stories and telling lies filled the tavern with noise. To the west, near where the mouth of the Gulf of Westmarch met the Frozen Sea, the sunset settled into the water, looking like dying red embers scattered from a stirred campfire.

He was broad-shouldered and a little overweight, a solid man who had seen an active life. His clothing was second-hand, worn but comfortable-looking, and warm enough against the cool winds blowing in from the north. He wore round-lensed spectacles, and Darrick could still count on the fingers of both hands how many times he\'92d seen such devices.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick paused, feeling that he\'92d admitted more than he should have.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  An irritable look filled the sage\'92s face. \'93Damnation, son. If you\'92re going to talk, then sit. I\'92ve been working hard for days here, and weeks and months before that in other places. Looking up gets hellaciously tiresome for me.\'94 He pointed at a chair across from him with the quill, then closed his book and put it aside.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Still feeling uncertain, Darrick pulled out the chair and sat. Out of habit, he laid his sheathed cutlass across his thighs.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sage laced his fingers together and rested both elbows on the tabletop. \'93Have you eaten tonight?\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No.\'94 Unloading imported goods from the ship and then loading exported goods had filled the day. Darrick had only eaten what he\'92d carried along in the food bag, which had been empty for hours.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick held himself in check. \'93I never said that I saw such a thing, now, did I?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A frown deepened the wrinkles over the sage\'92s eyes. \'93Are you always this churlish?\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Sir,\'94 Darrick stated evenly, \'93I don\'92t even know your name.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The serving wench returned with a platter of goat\'92s meat and shrimp and fish, backed by fresh bread and portions of melon that had shipped up that day. She offered mulled wine.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The temptation was there only for a moment for Darrick. For the last year he had tried to bury his life and his pain in wine and spirits. It hadn\'92t worked, and only old Sahyir had seen fit to save him from himself. But as the old man had told him, saving himself was a day-to-day job, and only one man could do that.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Tea,\'94 Darrick said. \'93Please.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The wench nodded and returned with a tall tankard of unsweetened tea.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93So,\'94 Taramis said, \'93about your demon\'97\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A fleeting smile touched the sage\'92s lips. \'93As you will. Where did you see the demon?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick ignored the question. He dipped his finger into the gravy on his plate and drew out the ellipses with the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint233}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint233}single line threading through them. He even drew the symbol so that the line went under and over the appropriate ellipses.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sage studied the gravy symbol. \'93Do you know what this is?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick shook his head.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Where did you see this?\'94 the sage asked.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Darrick replied. \'93You\'92ll get nothing from me until I\'92m convinced I\'92m getting something from you.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sage reached into the worn lizard-hide traveler\'92s pack in the chair beside him. Thoughtfully, he took out a pipe and a bag. After shoving the bowl full of tobacco, he set his pipe ablaze with the lantern. He smoked in silence, a hazy wreath forming around his head. He never blinked as he stared at Darrick.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Fresh-shaved that morning, Darrick hadn\'92t seen a more fiercely demanding gaze since the mirror then. Even the Westmarch ships\'92 officers paled by comparison. But he ate, savoring the hot food. By the working standards he was accustomed to in Seeker\'92s Point, the meal was an extravagance. The cargo handling he\'92d done for the day might have to feed him for two weeks in order to keep him from hunting meager game in the forest with winter soon to be breathing down their necks.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis reached back into his traveler\'92s pack and took out another book. Flipping through the tome, he stopped at a page, laid the book on the table, spun it around, and pushed it across the table toward Darrick. The sage moved the lantern so it shone on the pages more directly.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The demon that you saw,\'94 Taramis said. \'93Did it look anything like this?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick glanced at the page. The illustration was done by hand and in great detail.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The picture was the demon he\'92d seen at Tauruk\'92s Port, the one who had summoned the undead creatures responsible for Mat Hu-Ring\'92s death.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint234}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint234}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Not entirely responsible,\plain \f2\fs24 Darrick told himself, feeling his appetite ebb. He owned the majority of that responsibility. He kept eating mechanically, knowing it would be days or weeks before he had the chance to eat so well again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What do you know about the symbol?\'94 Darrick asked, not answering the sage\'92s question.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You\'92re a hard sell, aren\'92t you, boy?\'94 Taramis asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick broke a piece of bread and slathered honey butter onto it. He started eating while Taramis tried to wait him out.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Finally giving up, Taramis replied, \'93That symbol is the one that was longest associated with a demon called Kabraxis. He is supposed to be the guardian of the Twisted Path of Dreams and Shadows.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The Way of Dreams?\'94 Darrick asked, remembering the stories Sahyir had been telling about Bramwell that morning.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Interesting, isn\'92t it?\'94 the sage asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Sahyir told me he\'92d gone to church in Bramwell,\'94 Darrick said. \'93There\'92s a new church there called the Church of the Prophet of the Light. They also mention the Way of Dreams there.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis nodded. \'93They worship a prophet there named Dien-Ap-Sten.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Not Kabraxis?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It would be pretty stupid for a demon to be going around telling people to call him by his rightful name, now, wouldn\'92t it?\'94 Taramis grinned. \'93I mean, the whole bit of anonymity would be right out the window if that was the case. Most people wouldn\'92t worship a demon by choice, although there are some.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick waved a hand over his platter. \'93I appreciate this fine meal you went and bought me, I really do. But I have to tell you, if this story hasn\'92t picked up some by the time I finish, I\'92m out of here.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Kabraxis is an old and powerful demon,\'94 Taramis said.{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint235}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint235}\'93He\'92s been around, in one form or another, since the beginning of recorded history.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis puffed on his pipe. The coals in the pipe bowl glowed orange. \'93I believe this is the demon\'92s primary symbol. Did you see this in Bramwell?\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick sipped his tea and ignored the question. He pointedly returned his attention to his meal. The plate steadily emptied.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I don\'92t understand,\'94 Darrick said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sage seemed surprised. \'93You\'92ve had no priest\'92s training?\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis sighed. \'93All right, then. You intrigue me, and that\'92s the only reason I\'92m going to continue, because I will not tolerate being treated in such a cavalier manner.\'94 He tapped the ellipses. \'93These are the layers of man as divined by Kabraxis, Banisher of the Light.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Why is he called Banisher of the Light?\'94 Darrick asked.{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint236}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint236}He glanced around them, making sure none of the sailors or longshoremen was taking much interest in their conversation. In some communities, the discussion of demons was enough to get a man strung up or, at the least, tested by a dunking chair or a red-hot poker.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Because Kabraxis\'92s main objective in the world of man is to eclipse and replace Zakarum. Kabraxis worked during the Sin War to keep Zakarum from being brought forth by the Archangel Yaerius through his disciple Akarat.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What of the Archangel Inarius?\'94 Darrick asked, remembering the old stories he\'92d been told of the Sin War. \'93It was Inarius who first built a Cathedral of Light in this world.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Inarius grew overconfident and destroyed Mephisto\'92s temple, and Inarius was enslaved and returned with the Seraph to Hell to be tortured for all time. Kabraxis aided in Inarius\'92s downfall by winning them over to the demon\'92s side.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The war was primarily between Mephisto and Inarius,\'94 Taramis said. \'93Only a sage or someone who has had priest training would know of Kabraxis\'92s part in the Sin War. The Banisher of Light is a conniving demon. Kabraxis works in the shadows, stretching their boundaries till they cover the Light.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Again,\'94 Taramis said, \'93those ellipses represent the layers of man as Kabraxis perceives them.

You wear your pain like a chevron for anyone who has been through the same thing.\'94 He paused, his eyes sliding from Darrick\'92s for a moment. \'93I lost my family to a demon. Twenty-three years ago. I was a priest. Such a thing wasn\'92t supposed to happen to me. But a demon\'92s hand took my wife and my three children from me.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The lantern light flickered on the table.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I was young then and full of my studies as a Vizjerei{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint240}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint240}mage. I taught in one of the outlying schools in my homelands. A stranger came to our door. We lived in back of the school, just my family and I. This man told us that he had no place to sleep and had eaten nothing for two days. Fool that I was and full of my new position, I let him in. During the night, he killed my family. Only I lived, though most thought I would not.\'94 He pulled back the sleeves of his shirt, revealing the long, wicked scars across his flesh. \'93I have more scars over the rest of my body.\'94 He tilted his head back, revealing the thick scar that curved around half of his neck and across his throat. \'93The priests who saved me had to piece me back together. All of the healers told me later that I should have died. The Light knows I wanted to.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93But you lived,\'94 Darrick whispered, drawn into the horror of the story.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes.\'94 Taramis knocked ash from his pipe and put it away. \'93For a time, I resented my life. Then I came to realize that it was a more focused one. The demon that had killed my family would go on to kill other families. I resolved to get well, mentally and physically. And I did. It took me three years to heal and nine years to track down the demon that took my family from me. I had killed two other demons by that time and revealed four others.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes. When the Church of the Prophet of the Light first came into being, I became suspicious. So I began researching it and found enough similarities between the healing and the changes wrought within the worshippers to lead me in the direction of Kabraxis.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Then why come here?\'94 Darrick asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Because,\'94 the sage said, \'93Kabraxis was once here. For a time, the barbarian tribes worshipped him when they warred against the people of the southern lands. During that time he was known as Iceclaw the Merciless. He succeeded in uniting some of the more powerful barbarian tribes, creating a great horde that landed between the Twin Seas, the Great Ocean, and the Frozen Sea.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint241}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint241}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick considered the implications. The stories about the barbarian horde went so far back that they were considered only tales to frighten children with. The barbarians had been depicted as cannibalistic warriors who filed their teeth and filled their bellies from the bodies of women and children. \'93Until Hauklin came with his great sword, Stormfury, and slew Iceclaw during a battle that took six days.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis grinned. \'93You\'92ve heard the stories.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye,\'94 Darrick replied. \'93But that doesn\'92t answer why you\'92re here.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Because Stormfury is still here,\'94 the sage answered. \'93I came for the sword because it is the only thing that can slay Kabraxis.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It didn\'92t slay him the first time,\'94 Darrick pointed out.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The texts I read said that Kabraxis fled before the devastating might of Stormfury. Only in the stories of men was the demon reported dead. But I believe the sword has the power to kill Kabraxis. If you can track him back into the Burning Hells with it.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93If you knew all of this, why did you bother to talk to me?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sage\'92s eyes searched Darrick. \'93Because I am one man, Darrick Lang, and I\'92m not as young as I used to be.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You know my name?\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Of course.\'94 Taramis waved at the books before him. \'93I am a learned man. I heard the stories of the discovery of the demon at Tauruk\'92s Port more than a year ago while I was down in Westmarch. And I heard of the young navy officer who lost his best friend while carrying out a mission given him by the king\'92s nephew.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93So that I could convince you of my cause,\'94 Taramis said softly, \'93and perhaps your destiny.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What destiny?\'94 Darrick immediately felt trapped.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You\'92re tied to this thing somehow,\'94 the sage said. \'93You lost blood to Kabraxis, so perhaps that\'92s it. Or maybe there is something more that binds you to the demon.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I want nothing more to do with that demon,\'94 Darrick{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint242}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint242}said. But even as he said it, he felt uncertain, and with that uncertainty came a harsh wave of fear.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Really? Then how is it you\'92ve ended up here? Where the weapon that will cut Kabraxis down is?\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ve been drunk most of the past year,\'94 Darrick said. \'93I lost my post in the Westmarch Navy. Drunk and destitute most of the time, I only drifted from town to town, finding enough work to keep myself alive and away from Westmarch. I didn\'92t know I was here till I woke up damn near freezing to death. I knew nothing of that sword until you told me just now. I haven\'92t been following a demon\'92s trail.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You already knew who that symbol belonged to before you spoke to me,\'94 Taramis said. \'93Now that you know the demon is in Bramwell, hiding behind the mystical auguries of the Church of the Prophet of the Light, can you truly walk away from this?

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Unbidden, the memory of Mat plunging over the cliffside to his doom trickled through Darrick\'92s mind in slow motion again. The pain, once blinded and muffled by drink for the past year, twisted within him again as if it were new and fresh. Anger raged within him, but somehow he managed to keep it under control.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick hesitated, knowing that either answer he gave\'97and, perhaps, even giving no answer at all\'97would doom him.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Buyard Cholik stood on the platform above the snake\'92s head and awaited the arrival of his guest. Anticipation filled Cholik as he surveyed the empty pews around him. That morning, he had been enthused to see the large room overflowing with people. Every day the service was larger than the day before. There was no longer seating for all those in attendance. Even building as quickly as they were able, the construction crews weren\'92t able to keep pace with the growth.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Yet tonight there was only one person in attendance, and Cholik\'92s elation soared even higher. He remained silent as Lord Darkulan paused at the great central entrance.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Around the lord, a score of armored guards held lanterns and bared weapons. The lantern light glinted from scale mail and keen-edged steel. Voices whispered, and in their barely heard words Cholik detected fear and hostility.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan was a young man of thirty. His regal bearing showed the regimen he used to stay in shape as a warrior as well as a leader of men. An open-faced helmet with fierce curved horns framed his lean, hawklike features. A mustache followed the sneering curve up his mouth. He wore a dark green cloak that blended with his black breeches and tunic over a dark green shirt. Although it was hidden, Cholik was certain the lord wore the mystical chainmail armor beneath the tunic.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Impatiently, Lord Darkulan waved to one of his warriors.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The man nodded and stepped into the main area of the cathedral. His metal-shod boots clanked as he crossed the stone floor into the cathedral proper.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik raised his voice, knowing from the way the room was constructed that it would be easily heard. \'93Lord Darkulan, this meeting time was set aside for you. No one else may enter this part of the church.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik spoke words of power and thrust his hands straight out. Flames leapt from his fingertips and ignited the oil-filled channels around the snake\'92s head. Alive once more, the snake\'92s head leapt from the stone wall toward the guard.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Unnerved, the guard threw himself backward. His metal-shod boots scraped sparks from the stone floor as he hurried to rejoin the other guards. The warriors clustered around Lord Darkulan, trying to draw him back to safety. Lanterns swirled like a cloud of fireflies in the main entrance.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Would you have your mistress die?\'94 Cholik asked as he rode the swaying snake\'92s head. \'93Would you have your lady hung by the neck? Would you have your own good name dragged through the mud and dung of this city? Especially when I can change all that?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan cursed his men and fought them off him. Reluctantly, the warriors stepped away from him. Their leaders talked quickly to their lord, trying to get him to listen to their reason.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The lord paused at the mouth of the entrance and stared at Cholik atop the stone snake\'92s head. Below Cholik, fire{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint247}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint247}clung to the snake\'92s jaws, and he knew it must be a horrific sight in the middle of the dark cathedral.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93More like he\'92s a zombie,\'94 one of the guards muttered.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92m no zombie,\'94 Cholik said. \'93Come closer, Lord Darkulan, that you may hear my heartbeat. Perhaps, should you truly not believe, I\'92ll let you bleed me. Zombies and dead things don\'92t bleed as the living do.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Why can\'92t my men accompany me?\'94 Lord Darkulan asked.

He wondered if Kabraxis were watching, then realized that wasn\'92t the proper question. The proper question was from where the demon watched.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan took a lantern from one of his men, steeled himself for a moment, then strode into the cathedral. \'93How is it that you know so much about my business and the affairs of state?\'94 he demanded.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan\'92s hand dropped to the hilt of his saber. His voice turned gruff and hard. \'93Don\'92t press your luck, priest.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I stared death in the eye today, Lord Darkulan. Your threats won\'92t carry much weight with me. I know that I walk hand-in-hand with Dien-Ap-Sten.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You need me,\'94 Cholik told Lord Darkulan. \'93And you need the salvation that Dien-Ap-Sten can offer. If your mistress is saved, your wife will be saved. If both women are saved, your power will be saved.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The snake lay quiet and still, but the fiery eyes darted and watched. Its tongue, smoldering and steaming, flicked out rapidly, scenting the air.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik stopped in front of the snake, knowing the animated creature outlined him, making him seem like a dark shadow in front of a dreadful beast.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Perhaps you think you have sealed your doom by coming here tonight, Lord Darkulan,\'94 Cholik said softly.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The lord said nothing. Fear etched deep shadows into his face despite the light given off by his lantern and the snake.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I assure you,\'94 Cholik said, \'93that the opposite is true: you have sealed your future.\'94 He gestured at the snake, feeling the furnace blast of heat as the creature opened its jaws. \'93Walk with me, Lord Darkulan. Give your worries and fears over to Dien-Ap-Sten that he may make them go away.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan stood his ground.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You were here today,\'94 Cholik said. \'93You witnessed the miracle that Dien-Ap-Sten performed on the Black Road by separating the two boys locked in each other\'92s flesh. Have you ever seen such a thing done before?\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 the lord replied in a quaking voice.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hesitation showed on Lord Darkulan\'92s face.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93By morning,\'94 Cholik said, \'93it will be too late. The poison will have claimed the life of your mistress. Her father will demand the life of your wife in return.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Trying not to show his fear, Lord Darkulan stepped forward and allowed Cholik to take his arm and guide him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Be brave, Lord Darkulan,\'94 Cholik advised. \'93You are going to see wonders seldom seen by human eyes. Step into the snake\'92s mouth, and all your fear will be taken from you if you but believe.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan followed a half-step behind Cholik. They stepped over the stone snake\'92s sharp teeth and followed the black, smoldering ribbon of tongue down into the snake\'92s throat, where it became a black road that wound down into a long hallway.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Where are we?\'94 Lord Darkulan asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93On the Way of Dreams,\'94 Cholik replied. \'93We\'92re going to find your destiny. It takes a strong man to follow the teachings of Dien-Ap-Sten. You will become an even stronger man.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The hallway widened and changed a number of times, but the Black Road remained constant beneath Cholik\'92s feet. He\'92d talked to several parishioners who had ventured along the Black Road to be healed or receive a blessing, and all of them had described the path differently. Some had said they\'92d journeyed down familiar hallways, while others were taken through places they\'92d never seen and hoped they would never see.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A green sun dawned in the hallway before them, and suddenly they were no longer in a hallway. Now the Black Road clung to a cliffside. The path they followed was so high that clouds obscured the view below. Still, the harsh mountain range towered above. Ice glinted on the peaks only a little farther up.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan stopped. \'93I want to go back.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You can\'92t,\'94 Cholik replied. \'93Look.\'94 He turned and pointed back along the way they had come.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Flames clung to the Black Road, twisting and curling three times the height of a man.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The only way open to you is forward,\'94 Cholik said.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ve made a mistake,\'94 Lord Darkulan announced.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93This was not the first,\'94 Cholik replied.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Spinning abruptly, Lord Darkulan raised his sword, bringing it to within inches of Cholik\'92s unprotected throat. \'93You will let me out of here now, or I\'92ll have your head from your shoulders!\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Secure in the knowledge that Kabraxis watched over him, Cholik grasped the sword. The sharp edges cut into the flesh of his hand. Blood trickled down the blade and dripped to the Black Road, giving birth to fist-sized fires at their feet.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Cholik said, \'93you won\'92t.\'94 Power coursed through him, turning the sword red-hot in a heartbeat.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Screaming in pain, Lord Darkulan released his weapon and stumbled back. He held his burned hand in disbelief.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik ignored the sizzling pain of his own burning hand, ignored the stink of scorched flesh and the smoke that curled up. Much worse things had happened to him during the trips down the Black Road that Kabraxis had led him on. He could still occasionally feel the demon\'92s talons rooting around inside his brain, scraping against his skull.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Swiveling, Cholik flung the lord\'92s sword over the cliff\'92s edge. He held out his burned and bleeding hand for inspection.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You\'92re insane,\'94 Lord Darkulan said in disbelief.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Cholik stated calmly. \'93I believe in Dien-Ap-Sten and the power of the Way of Dreams.\'94 He held his hand up. Even as he watched, the cuts knitted together, and the burns healed and went away. In less than a moment, his hand was completely healed. \'93You can believe, too. Hold out your hand, and accept what I am telling you.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Trembling, afraid, and hurting, Lord Darkulan held his hand up.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint252}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint252}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Believe,\'94 Cholik said softly. \'93Believe, and you will be given the power to heal yourself and end your misery.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan concentrated. Sweat popped out on his brow. \'93I can\'92t,\'94 he whispered hoarsely. \'93Please, I beg you. Make the pain go away.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I can\'92t,\'94 Cholik said. \'93That is for you to do. Just come to Dien-Ap-Sten willingly. Only a little faith is needed. Trust that.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Slowly, then, Lord Darkulan\'92s hand began to heal. The burns scabbed over, and only a moment or two after that, smooth flesh remained where the horrible burns had been.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ve done it.\'94 Lord Darkulan gazed at his uninjured hand in disbelief. His fingers still trembled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes,\'94 Cholik said. \'93But the worst is yet to come.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Without warning, the ledge broke away, dropping them into the abyss over the clouds.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan screamed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik controlled his own fear. He was on the Black Road now. The warriors and priests who had become part of his inner circle had all experienced much worse than this. All of those men who had reached this point had to relive a horrific nightmare that was their deepest secret.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The bottom of the long fall through the cottony clouds wasn\'92t the bone-breaking stop against jagged rocks that Cholik had expected. Instead, he landed light as a feather in the midst of a moon-dappled bog under a clear night sky.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan plummeted into the bog, disappearing with a huge splash that threw black mud in all directions.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik grew worried after a time that something had gone wrong. Initiates had died along the way of the Black Road, but generally Kabraxis was selective about who was brought into the inner circle.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93He\'92s fine,\'94 the demon said. \'93Give him a moment more. I found this place and this event in a tight secret place that he seldom goes to these days. Pay attention.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik waited, amazed that he could stand on the bog\'92s surface tension.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint253}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint253}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then Lord Darkulan shoved an arm up through the bog, clapped it onto a semi-submerged tree trunk that had fallen a long time ago. Mud covered his head and face, stripping away the regal look and leaving only the frightened man behind.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan reached toward Cholik. \'93Help me! Hurry!\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What is he afraid of?\'94 Cholik asked Kabraxis. Neither of them made a move toward the struggling lord. \'93The bog is not so deep that he will drown.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93He fears the past,\'94 the demon said. \'93And he should.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Fearfully, Lord Darkulan gazed over his shoulder at the swamp. Naked and dead trees stood out from the loose mud. Dead brush with ashy, curling leaving lined the shore. Skeletons of small creatures, some of them recently dead so that patches of fur clung to them, lay partially submerged in the swamp and on the shore. Dead birds clung upside down by their claws from naked tree branches. Frog corpses floated in the bog.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan screamed, then was pulled under the bog by something strong and fierce. Bubbles erupted from the mud.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Is he going to die here?\'94 Cholik asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93He will,\'94 Kabraxis answered, \'93if I don\'92t save him. He can\'92t fight this nightmare. It\'92s too strong for him.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The man\'92s arm shot out of the bog again, found the tree trunk, and succeeded in pulling himself out of the muck. When he appeared, a skeleton clung to his back.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Years of submersion in the bog had turned the dead woman\'92s skin to leather, and it sank in tightly to her skull. Once, Cholik knew, she might have been pretty, but there was no way to know that now. The soft blue dress that might once have hidden womanly curves now clung to the emaciated form of the horror that rode Lord Darkulan\'92s back. The dead woman bent close to him, teeth showing through her ruined flesh. She licked out a dead, leathery tongue that caught his ear, then drew it back between her broken teeth. When she bit down, crushing the earlobe like a grape, crimson sprayed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint254}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint254}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan screamed in pain and flailed, trying desperately to shove the dead woman from him and haul himself onto the tree trunk.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Help me!\'94 the lord called out.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Who is the woman?\'94 Cholik asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Once,\'94 Kabraxis said, \'93she was his lover. It was during the early years before his marriage. She was a common girl named Azyka, a shopkeeper\'92s daughter. Before the marriage, she told Lord Darkulan she was going to have his child. Knowing he couldn\'92t allow that, Lord Darkulan killed her and left her body in this bog outside Bramwell.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The girl was never found?\'94 Cholik asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik watched the horrified lord fighting to maintain his grip on the moss-encrusted tree trunk. The dead woman\'92s weight steadily bore him under. Cholik was not amazed by Kabraxis\'92s story. As a priest of the Zakarum Church, he was no stranger to the special privileges invoked by royalty. In Westmarch\'92s history, several murders had been forgotten about and the murderers absolved by special dispensation from the church.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Help me!\'94 Lord Darkulan screamed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kabraxis strode forward. His large feet left only small ripples on the bog water and never once became wet. \'93Lord Darkulan,\'94 the demon called.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The lord glanced up, seeing the demon for the first time. For a moment, Lord Darkulan froze, but the dead woman chewing his ear into ragged, bloody bits caught his attention again. He fought against her, losing his grip on the tree trunk and plunging into the bog up to his chin. The dead woman\'92s hair floated on the bog water.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Lord Darkulan,\'94 the demon said. \'93I am Dien-Ap-Sten. I am your salvation.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You\'92re no salvation,\'94 Lord Darkulan cried. \'93You\'92re a demon.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And you\'92re a drowning man,\'94 Kabraxis stated. \'93Accept me or die.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ll not be tricked by one of your illusions\'97\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The dead woman reached up behind Lord Darkulan and knotted her skeletal fingers in his hair. When she yanked, Lord Darkulan vanished beneath the black muck of the bog.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kabraxis stood patiently waiting.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  For a moment, Cholik believed it was done and that the lord had died in the bog with the specter of the girl he had murdered so long ago. The chill of the swamp blew through Cholik, and he wrapped his arms around himself. As many times as he had ventured down the Black Road, he had never gotten used to the experience. Each time was unique, each fear different.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan\'92s hand broke the surface, and Kabraxis\'92s hand was there to catch it. Effortlessly, the demon hauled the lord from the muck and the mire with the dead woman still riding him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Live or die,\'94 Kabraxis offered calmly. \'93The choice is yours.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan hesitated only a moment. \'93Live. May the Light forgive me, I want to live.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A cruel smile carved Kabraxis\'92s horrendous face. \'93\plain \f2\i\fs24 I\plain \f2\fs24 forgive you,\'94 the demon mocked. He continued pulling the muddy, bloody lord from the swamp. The dead woman still clung to Lord Darkulan\'92s back, biting his mangled ear and scratching his face with the claws of her free hand.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kabraxis backhanded the dead woman from Lord Darkulan\'92s back. When he finished hauling the man up, Cholik found that they all once more stood on the solid ground of the Black Road twisting through the high mountains. The swamp was nowhere to be seen.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan gave in to his fear, shaking and shivering before the demon\'92s wrath. \'93Don\'92t kill me,\'94 the lord pleaded.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I won\'92t kill you,\'94 Kabraxis said, pushing the man to his knees before him, humbling him. \'93I am going to give you your life.\'94

I will be your design.\'94 The fingers elongated into sharp spikes. \'93By your own hand and childish desires of flesh, you are unmade. I will make you a man and a leader of men.\'94 With a quick snap of his wrist, the demon drove his spiked fingers through Lord Darkulan\'92s skull.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lightning flashed through the dark sky above the mountains, followed immediately by the rumbling roar of thunder that shattered all other sounds. The Black Road trembled beneath Cholik\'92s feet, and for a dreadful moment he thought the whole mountain range was going to fall.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then the lightning and the thunder faded, and Kabraxis withdrew his spiked fingers from Lord Darkulan\'92s skull.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Lord Darkulan agreed and offered his undying loyalty to the demon once more, then followed the Black Road{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint257}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint257}back out of the stone snake\'92s mouth.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93There\'92s no way to tighten security completely in the church,\'94 Cholik objected. \'93We admit too many people, and many of them we can\'92t identify, to screen everyone.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Of course,\'94 Cholik said, bowing his head and watching as the demon vanished from sight. Cholik\'92s thoughts rushed, scrambling over one another in his head. Who was this demon hunter Kabraxis feared? In their year and more together, Cholik had never seen the demon concerned about anything.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Although he\'92d ridden horses a few times while working with overland trade caravans, Darrick had never grown used to their lurching gait. Even a ship\'92s deck riding the crests of a storm-tossed sea felt more certain than the beast beneath him as it picked its way down the forested hillside.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Luckily, the animal followed Taramis Volken\'92s mount along the narrow trail and required no real guidance from him. He only wished he could sleep in the saddle as some of the other men accompanying them seemed able to do.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Last night at the Blue Lantern tavern, Darrick would not have guessed that Taramis headed the small army of men encamped outside Seeker\'92s Point. But after witnessing their professionalism and dedication to their quest, he understood how they could have escaped notice.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  All of the warriors rode in single file along the trail. Two riderless horses testified to the fact that scouts ranged on foot ahead of the group. The men rode with hardly any noise, their gear carefully padded so that nothing clinked or clanked. They were hard-eyed men, like wolves that hunted in a pack. The wintry wind and the leaden, overcast sky of morning further brought that appearance out.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick straightened in the saddle, trying to find a comfortable position. Since leaving the Blue Lantern last evening, he\'92d ridden all night. A few times he\'92d dozed in the saddle, exhaustion finally overcoming his fear of falling off the horse, but that had been reawakened after only a moment or two when he woke and found himself sliding.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A birdcall sounded in the quiet of the forest.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick\'92s sharp ears picked the sound out, recognizing that it was false only because he\'92d heard the same cry earlier. The call came from one of the two scouts ahead. During the night, they\'92d used owl calls to communicate, but this morning they emulated a small ruby-throated wren that sailors sometimes took on board sailing ships to raise.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  One of the scouts stepped from the forest and loped alongside Taramis Volken\'92s mount, matching the long-limbed animal with ease. The scout and the sage talked briefly, then the scout disappeared again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis appeared unconcerned, so Darrick tried to relax. His muscles were stiff and sore from hauling cargo the day before and the long ride during the night. More than anything, he wanted off the horse, and he wished he\'92d stayed in Seeker\'92s Point. He had no business among these men. They all seemed to be veteran warriors, and the few words that Darrick had overheard them say alluded to past battles with demons, though none of them was as powerful as Kabraxis.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick pushed his breath out, watching it fog briefly in the chill of morning. He couldn\'92t imagine why Taramis had asked him to come along when there were already so many warriors.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A little farther on, the trail they followed led out into a cleared space. Among a littering of tree stumps sat a small house with a thatched roof. The land to the south of the house had been cleared for gardening. The current crop appeared to be onions and carrots, but there were stands where vine crops had grown during the summer. In back of the garden was a door set into a small hill that Darrick believed would lead to a root cellar. A well occupied the space between the garden and the small barn.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  An old man and a young boy came out of the barn. They looked enough alike that Darrick believed they were family, probably grandfather and grandson.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The old man carried a pitchfork and a milking pail. He{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint260}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint260}handed the pail to the boy and waved him back into the barn. The old man was bald and had a long gray beard. He wore deerskin outer garments, but the neck of a purple blouse showed under the jacket.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93May the Light bless you,\'94 the old man said, holding the pitchfork in both hands. A little fear showed in his eyes, but the confident manner in which he wielded the pitchfork told Darrick that the old man was prepared for trouble.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And may the Light bless you,\'94 Taramis said, reining his horse in at a respectful distance from the old man. \'93My name is Taramis Volken, and if I got your directions right, you\'92d be Ellig Barrows.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye,\'94 the old man said, keeping his stance open. His bright blue eyes roved over the warriors and Darrick. \'93And if you\'92re who you says you are, I\'92ve heard of you.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I am,\'94 Taramis said, swinging down from his horse with easy grace. \'93I\'92ve got papers that prove it right enough.\'94 He reached inside his blouse. \'93They bear the king\'92s mark.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The old man held up a hand. A light sapphire glow enveloped Taramis. For a moment a ruby glow surrounded the sage and kept the sapphire glow from him. Then the ruby light faded and vanished entirely.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It\'92s not imposition,\'94 the old man assured him. \'93As you can tell from the trail you followed up, we seldom have company here.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I need you to know something further,\'94 Taramis said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Ellig regarded him. \'93You\'92ve come for the sword. I knew{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint261}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint261}that from the reading I took of you. Come on inside the house, and we\'92ll talk. Then we\'92ll see if you get it or not.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis waved to his men to dismount, and Darrick dismounted with them. The wind whistled through the trees overhead.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik found Kabraxis in one of the rooftop gardens. The demon faced north, his arms folded over his broad chest. The illusion spell he maintained over the garden prevented anyone in the street below from seeing him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Pausing, Cholik peered over the roof\'92s side, spotting the steady stream of worshippers pouring into the building.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You sent for me?\'94 Cholik asked, coming to a halt behind the demon. Kabraxis had, of course, because Cholik wouldn\'92t have heard the demon\'92s voice in his head while he was preparing for the morning service otherwise.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes,\'94 Kabraxis said. \'93In dealing with the man I\'92d learned of, I found out something else interesting.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Taramis Volken?\'94 Cholik asked. He remembered the demon hunter\'92s name from the previous night\'92s conversation.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes. But there is another man that I recognize with Taramis Volken\'92s group. I wanted you to look at him as well.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Of course.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Kabraxis turned and crossed the rooftop to one of the small pools in the garden. Passing a hand over the pool, the demon stepped back. \'93Look.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Moving forward, Cholik knelt and gazed into the pool. Ripples passed over the water\'92s surface, then settled out again. For a moment, Cholik only saw the reflected blue of the sky.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then the image formed, showing a small house tucked away under the embrace of tall fir, maple, and oak trees. Warriors sat outside the small house, all of them rough-looking and hard traveled. Cholik knew at once that there were too many of them to live at the house. They were visitors, then, but he didn\'92t recognize the house.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint262}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint262}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Do you see him?\'94 Kabraxis demanded.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I see many men,\'94 Cholik replied.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Here.\'94 Kabraxis gestured impatiently.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The pool rippled and clouded for a moment, then cleared once more and focused on a wan young man with reddish hair pulled back into a queue. Seated at the base of a big oak tree, a cutlass across his knees, the young man appeared to sleep with his back to the tree. A ragged scar marred one of his eyebrows.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Do you recognize him?\'94 Kabraxis asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes,\'94 Cholik replied, recognizing the man now. \'93He was at Tauruk\'92s Port.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And now he is with Taramis Volken,\'94 Kabraxis mused.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93They know each other?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Not that I was aware of. For all I know, Taramis Volken and this man, Darrick Lang, met each other in Seeker\'92s Point last evening.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You have spies watching the demon hunter?\'94 Cholik asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93When I am not watching the man myself, of course. Taramis Volken is a dangerous human, and the quest he\'92s on pertains to us. If he is given what he seeks at this farmer\'92s house, his next move will be to come for us.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What is it he seeks?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Stormfury,\'94 Kabraxis replied.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The mystic sword that turned the barbarian horde hundreds of years ago?\'94 Cholik asked. His nimble mind searched for the reasons Kabraxis would be interested in the sword and why he would think that the demon hunter would turn his sights on them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The same.\'94 A grimace twisted the demon\'92s hideous face.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik thought then that Kabraxis was afraid of the sword and what it might do, but he also knew he dared not mention that. Desperately, he tried to eradicate the errant thought from his mind before the demon sensed it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The sword can be a problem,\'94 Kabraxis said, \'93but I have minions that are even now closing in on Taramis{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint263}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint263}Volken and his band. They won\'92t escape, and if the sword is there, my minions will retrieve it.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik thought and worked to couch his words carefully. \'93How is the sword a problem?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It is a powerful weapon,\'94 Kabraxis said. \'93A blacksmith imbued with the power of the Light forged the sword hundreds of years ago to use against the barbarian horde and the dark force they worshipped.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Understanding dawned in Cholik. \'93They worshipped you. You were Iceclaw.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes. And the humans used the sword to drive me from this world then.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Can it be used against you again?\'94 Cholik asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I am more powerful now than I was then,\'94 Kabraxis said. \'93Still, I will see to it that the sword is destroyed forever and always after this day.\'94 The demon paused. \'93But the presence of this other man troubles me.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Why?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I have cast auguries to show the portents of the things we have done concerning Lord Darkulan,\'94 Kabraxis said. \'93This man keeps turning up in them.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik considered that. Spies he had placed inside the lord\'92s keep had relayed that Darkulan\'92s mistress was already better and on her way back to a full recovery. Lord Darkulan had visited her immediately after leaving the church last evening.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93When did you see this man again after Tauruk\'92s Port?\'94 Cholik asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Only moments ago,\'94 Kabraxis said. \'93When I summoned the lezanti and set them upon the hunt for Taramis Volken and his warriors. I had to scry upon the group to set the lezanti upon the scent.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A shudder passed through Cholik when he considered the lezanti. He\'92d always believed the creatures to be truly the stuff of legends and myth.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  According to the tales he\'92d been told, the lezanti were created by the blending of a human female\'92s corpse, a freshly slain wolf, and a lizard, creating a fast and ferocious{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint264}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint264}chimera that possessed super-animal cunning, a partially upright physique, and an ability to take a lot of damage and grow limb replacements after amputation.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93If you\'92ve only just now seen this man,\'94 Cholik said, \'93how do you know he was the one you saw in your auguries?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Do you distrust my abilities, Buyard Cholik?\'94 the demon demanded.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Cholik replied quickly, not wanting Kabraxis to vent the cold rage that filled him. \'93I just wondered how you kept him separate from Taramis Volken or another of the warriors with him.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Because I can,\'94 the demon replied. \'93Just as I robbed time of your years and returned your youth to you.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik stared into the pool, looking into the young man\'92s relaxed face. He wondered how the young man had gotten there, more than a year after the events at Tauruk\'92s Port.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I am concerned because of the magic that was used to open the gateway,\'94 Kabraxis said. \'93When demons come from the Burning Hells, so, too, come the seeds of their potential downfall. It is a balance that is kept between the Light and the Darkness. But by the same hand, no champion of the Light may burst forth without a weakness that can be exploited. It\'92s up to the champion which propensity\'97strength or weakness\'97wins out. And it is up to the demon whether he stands against the power that would banish him from this plane again.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And you think such power has been assigned to this man because he was there the night you came through the gateway back into our world?\'94 Cholik asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No. This man doesn\'92t have such power. And there is a great affinity for darkness in his soul.\'94 The demon smiled. \'93In fact, were we able to get him here and persuade him properly, I think he could be turned to serve me. There is weakness in him as well as strength. I feel it would be no problem to exploit that weakness.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Then why the concern?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The juxtaposition of all the variables,\'94 Kabraxis said.{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint265}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint265}\'93Taramis Volken\'92s discovery of Stormfury is bad enough, but for this man to appear here so soon after the burned man attempted to kill you, I have to consider how threatening our situation can get. The balance between Light and Dark has always been maintained, and somewhere out there is a threat I have to recognize.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Staring into the pool of water as the view shifted and pulled back, Cholik watched the sleek forms of the lezanti cluster along the ridgeline around the small house. The lezanti stood hunchbacked and broad-shouldered on two clawed feet and legs that bent backward like a horse\'92s rear legs. Lizard\'92s skin hugged the body and shifted colors as quickly as a chameleon\'92s, allowing them to blend into their surroundings with astonishing ease. Tufts of fur spread over their shoulders, crowned their heads around their small triangular ears, and covered their flanks where a hairless lizard\'92s tail flicked and twisted. Their jaws were filled with large fangs.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The church bells rang, signaling the beginning of the morning service.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik stood, waiting for the order to dismiss and return to the church. \'93This situation is under your control,\'94 he said. \'93The lezanti will leave no one alive.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Perhaps,\'94 Kabraxis said. He gestured toward the pool.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  In the image trapped in the water, the lezanti began stealthily closing in on the warriors and the little house in the forest. Hypnotized, remembering the violence the demon-formed creatures were reputed to be capable of, Cholik watched while the cathedral below them continued to fill.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick sat under the spreading oak tree a short distance from the house and held the deep wooden plate he\'92d been given in his hands. He wished the house had been bigger or that there had been fewer men. The dark chimney smoke pouring into the air let him know there was a fire inside. He wasn\'92t truly cold, but a chance to sit by the fire for a few moments to break the chill that covered him would have been welcome.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint266}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint266}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The generosity Ellig Barrows showed his unexpected guests was amazing. It was one thing for the old man to have been willing to care for such a large group, but it was even more surprising that he was able to. Breakfast consisted of simple fare: eggs, stringy venison chops, potato mush, thick brown gravy, and fat wedges of bread. But it was all warm and welcome.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  As it turned out, both of Taramis\'92s scouts had taken deer in the forest and dressed them out to replace the meat they ate from the old man\'92s larder. There was no replacing the bread, though, and Darrick guessed that the old man\'92s wife would be busy for several days baking to replace what they\'92d consumed that morning.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick sopped up the last of the gravy and eggs with his remaining piece of bread and drank from his waterskin. Setting the plate to one side for the moment, he enjoyed the sensation of being full and off the horse. He pulled a blanket from his pack and wrapped it around his shoulders.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Winter was coming, marching down from the harsh northlands. Soon enough, mornings would be filled with frost and cold that made a man\'92s bones ache. Darrick kept to himself, watching the other warriors break up into small groups and talk among themselves. As they ate, the warriors also relieved the guards posted in the forest, making sure everyone was fed and rested.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Ellig Barrows and Taramis Volken talked on the covered porch in front of the house. Each man seemed intent on taking the measure of the other. Taramis wore orange-colored robes with silver designs worked into them. During his travels, Darrick had heard descriptions of the Vizjerei robes, but he had never seen them before. The enchanted robes offered protection from spells and demonic creatures.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick knew that Taramis sought to persuade the old man to give him Stormfury, the sword from the old legend. Although he\'92d seen a number of things in his life as a sailor for Westmarch even before he\'92d seen the demon at Tauruk\'92s Port, Darrick had never seen anything as legendary as the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint267}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint267}sword. His mind played with the idea of it, what it might look like and what powers it might hold. But again and again, his thoughts insisted on coming back to why Taramis would believe he belonged with them on this quest.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Darrick,\'94 Taramis called a few minutes later.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Rousing from near slumber, regretting the need to move when he\'92d finally gotten comfortable against the tree, Darrick glanced at the sage.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Come with us,\'94 Taramis requested, standing and following the old man across the yard.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Reluctantly, Darrick got to his feet and carried the plate to the porch, where it was taken by the old man\'92s grandson. Darrick followed Taramis and Ellig Barrows into the root cellar built into the hillside.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The old man took a lantern from the root cellar\'92s wall inside, lit it with a coal he\'92d carried from the house, and followed the short flight of earthen stairs down into the small root cellar.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick hesitated in the doorway. The cloying smell of dank earth, potatoes, onions, and spices filled his nostrils. He didn\'92t like the darkness of the cellar or the closed-in feeling he got from the racks of foods canned in jars or the wine bottles. For a house in the middle of nowhere along the Frozen Sea coast, Ellig Barrows and his family had a large larder.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Come on,\'94 Taramis said, following the old man to the back of the cellar.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick crossed the uneven floor dug from the earth and covered with small rock. The cellar\'92s ceiling was so low his head scraped a couple of times, and he kept hunkered down.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A huge stone surface blocked the other end of the cellar. The lantern Ellig Barrows carried clanked against the stone as he stood next to it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I was given care of the sword,\'94 the old man said, turning to face Taramis, \'93along with the power to do so by my grandfather, as he was given the power to care for it by his grandfather. I teach this responsibility and power to my own{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint268}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint268}grandson now.

The sword appeared plain and unadorned, hammered from steel with a craftsman\'92s skill but lacking the touch of an artist. The blade was an infantryman\'92s weapon, not something that would invoke fear in demons.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I hadn\'92t thought of it like that,\'94 Darrick admitted. But he also wondered if someone had stolen the real sword a long time ago and left the barbaric piece in its stead.

Although the caverns under Tauruk\'92s Port were larger and the huge doorway had seemed more threatening, the dead man lying with the sword clasped in his hands seemed just as deadly. Darrick would have gladly left the crypt and been satisfied never to see anything more of a magical nature.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis turned and reached for the sword. His hand halted, quivering, in the air several inches from the weapon.

Demons come into this world, and a means of defeating them is also created. If the Light tries to upset the balance by introducing an object of power that can be used against the Darkness, the powers of Darkness intercede to make the balance whole again. Ultimately, the true threat to the balance, whether the Light or the Darkness has the greater power in our world, is left up to us. The people. Just as when the Prime Evils appeared in this world during the time that came to be known as the Dark Exile, the Angel Tyreal gathered the magi, warriors, and scholars in the East and formed the Brotherhood of the Horadrim. Those people would never have come together with such power if the demons had not been loosed in our world.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis put his hand on Darrick\'92s shoulder. \'93But the demon is back,\'94 the sage said. \'93We know that, don\'92t we? The demon is back, and the sword should come free.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93But am I the one?\'94 Darrick asked in a hoarse voice.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You must be,\'94 Taramis said. \'93I can think of no other. Your friend died in that place. There has to be a reason you were spared. It\'92s the balance, Darrick. The needs of the Light must always be balanced against the power of the Darkness.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick gazed at the sword. The stink of the barn behind his father\'92s butcher shop returned to him.\plain \f2\i\fs24 You\'92ll never amount to anything!\plain \f2\fs24 his father had shouted.\plain \f2\i\fs24 You\'92re dumb, and you\'92re stupid, and you\'92re going to die dumb and stupid!\plain \f2\fs24 Days and weeks and years of that rolled through Darrick\'92s head. Pain tingled through his body again, reminding him of the whippings he\'92d endured and somehow survived. His father\'92s voice had often haunted him during the past year, and he\'92d tried to drown it in wine and spirits, in hard work and bleak disappointment.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hadn\'92t that been punishment enough? Darrick stared at the simple sword clasped in the dead man\'92s hands.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And if I can\'92t take the sword?\'94 Darrick asked in a ragged voice.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Then I will search out the true secret,\'94 Taramis said. \'93Or I will find another way to battle Kabraxis and his accursed Church of the Prophet of the Light.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But the sage believed in him, and Darrick knew that. It was almost too much to bear.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Pushing away his own fears, going numb and dead inside the way he had when he\'92d faced his father in that{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint274}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint274}small barn in Hillsfar, Darrick stepped toward the dead man. He reached for the sword.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Inches from the blade\'92s hilt, his hand froze, and he found he was unable to go any farther.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I can\'92t,\'94 Darrick said, refusing to give in, wanting desperately to be able to pick up the sword and prove his worth even if only to himself.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Try,\'94 Taramis said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick watched his hand shake with the effort he was making. It felt as if he were pushing against a stone wall. Pain welled up inside him, but it had nothing to do with the sword.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  You\'92re stupid, boy, and you\'92re lazy. Not worth the time or the trouble or the food to keep you.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick fought the barrier, willing his hand to pass through. He pressed his whole body against it now, feeling it support most of his weight.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Ease off,\'94 Taramis said.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick strained for the sword, wanting even another fraction of an inch if he could get it. It felt as if his finger bones were going to pass through the flesh. Pain raced up his arm, and he clenched his teeth against it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  I should have knocked you in the head the day you were born, boy. That way you wouldn\'92t have lived to be such a disgrace.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Give it up,\'94 Taramis said.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No!\'94 Darrick said in a loud voice.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sage reached for him, gripping him by the shoulder and trying to pull him away.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You\'92re going to get hurt, lad,\'94 Ellig Barrows said. \'93You can\'92t force this thing.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Pain dimmed Darrick\'92s hearing. Images of Mat falling from the cliffside spun through his brain again. Guilt filled Darrick, echoed by the worthlessness he felt from his father\'92s oft-repeated words. For a moment, he thought the pain was going to destroy him, melt him down where he{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint275}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint275}stood. He was locked in the pursuit of the sword, didn\'92t think he could pull back if he wanted to.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  And where would he go from here after failing this? He had no answers.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then a calm, cool voice holding just a hint of mocking amusement filled his head.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Take up the sword, skipper.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Mat?\'94 Darrick said aloud. He was so surprised at hearing Mat\'92s voice that he didn\'92t even realize at first that he had fallen across the corpse, bruising his knees against the earthen floor. Instinctively, his hand curled around the sword\'92s hilt, but he glanced around the shadows of the crypt looking for Mat Hu-Ring.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Only Taramis and Ellig Barrows stood there.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93By the Light,\'94 the old man whispered. \'93He has taken the sword.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis smiled in triumph. \'93As I told you he would.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick gazed down at the dead man so close to him. The corpse felt unnaturally cold.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Take the sword, Darrick,\'94 the sage urged.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Slowly, disbelieving, not knowing if he\'92d truly heard Mat\'92s voice or it had been part of some spell that opened the ward protecting the sword or a delusion of his own, Darrick pulled the sword away from the dead warrior. Despite its length and unfamiliar style, the sword felt comfortable in Darrick\'92s hand. He stood, holding it out before him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Something in the scarred and dark metal caught the light of Ellig Barrows\'92s lantern, glinting dulled silver.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Tentatively, Taramis reached for the sword, but his hand stopped inches away. \'93I still cannot touch the sword.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The old man tried to touch the weapon as well but with the same results. \'93Nor can I. None in my family has ever been able to touch the sword. Whenever we moved it, we had to move Hauklin\'92s body as well.\'94 A note of sadness sounded in the old man\'92s voice.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  For the first time, Darrick realized that taking the sword would leave the old man and his grandson with nothing to care for or protect. Darrick gazed at the old man. \'93I\'92m sorry,\'94 he whispered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint276}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint276}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Ellig Barrows nodded. \'93All of us who have defended the sword have prayed that this day would come, this day when we would be free of our burden, but to see it actually happen\'97\'94 Words failed him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Taramis!\'94 one of the men shouted from outside.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Even as the sage started for the magical door, the sound of inhuman and monstrous yips and growls cascaded into the root cellar.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick followed the sage, bolting through the racks of foodstuffs and wines, trailed by Ellig Barrows with the lantern. The weak gray daylight pouring through the root cellar door marked the entrance.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The noise of men fighting, their curses and yells, as well as the growls and howls of the creatures they fought, pummeled Darrick\'92s ears as he raced up the earthen steps. He was on Taramis\'92s heels as they burst from the root cellar.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The clearing around the house, which had moments ago been peaceful and restful, was now filled with battle. Taramis\'92s warriors formed a quick skirmish line against the bloodthirsty beasts that raged against them from the forest.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Lezanti,\'94 Taramis breathed. \'93By the Light, Kabraxis has found us out.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick recognized the demon-forged beasts, but only from tales he\'92d been told aboard ship. Even in all of his travels, he\'92d never before encountered the creatures.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The lezanti stood a little less than five feet tall. They were human-shaped, but they possessed the reverse-hinged knees of a wolf and the thick hide of a lizard. The head was lizard-shaped as well, bearing an elongated snout filled with serrated teeth and flat, flaring nostrils. The eyes were close-set under a hank of wooly hair and surprisingly human. The hands and feet were oversized, filled with huge claws. Lizards\'92 tails, barbed on the ends, swung around behind them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Archers!\'94 Taramis cried hoarsely as he stood his ground and began weaving his hands through the air, inscribing symbols that flared to flaming life.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Four warriors took up longbows, stood behind swordsmen,{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint277}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint277}and drew back shafts. They had two arrows away each, dropping the lezanti in their tracks, before the first wave of the creatures reached them. Then the swordsmen held them back with their shields, staggered by the lezantis\'92 speed, strength, and weight. The clang of flesh meeting steel boomed in the clearing.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Darrick,\'94 Taramis said, his hands still moving, \'93hold the door to the house. There are women and children inside. Hurry.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick ran, trusting the line of warriors to protect his back as he made for the small house.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis unleashed a wave of shimmering force that hit the center of the lezanti pack, scattering them and showering them with flame. Several of the smoldering bodies hung in the trees or landed with bone-breaking thumps against the ground. Only a few of them tried to get up. The archers calmly nocked more shafts and fired again, as cool as any crew Darrick had ever seen. The clothyard shafts drilled into the eyes and throats of their foes, putting them down. But the odds were not in the favor of the warriors. They numbered twenty-six men, including Darrick, and there had to be at least eighty of the lezantis.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  We\'92re going to die,\plain \f2\fs24 Darrick thought, but he never once considered running. Hauklin\'92s mystical sword felt calm and certain in his hand despite the unaccustomed length.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A scrabbling sound alerted Darrick. He swung around in time to see the lezanti on the roof of the house leap at him, its claws reaching for him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick ducked beneath the creature\'92s attack, set himself as it thudded against the ground. Not dazed even for a moment, the lezanti came up snarling and snapping. The elongated snout shot at Darrick\'92s head. He parried the head with the sword, then drove a boot into the lezanti\'92s stomach, doubling it over.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Still moving, Darrick stepped to the side and brought the sword down in a hand-and-a-half grip that powered the blade into the creature\'92s side. To his surprise, the sword sliced through the lezanti, dropping it to the ground in{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint278}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint278}halves. The body parts quivered and jerked, then lay still. Blue energy crackled along the sword\'92s length, and the lezanti\'92s blood dried and flaked away, leaving the steel clean of it again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Men cursed and fought out in the clearing, striving to hold back the merciless horde of creatures. Two men were down, Darrick saw, and others were wounded. Taramis unleashed another bolt of mystical energy, and two of the lezantis were covered in ice, frozen in place, shattering beneath the blades of the warriors who took advantage of their weakness.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Racing into the house, Darrick surveyed the small room filled with carvings and a few books. Ellig Barrows\'92s wife, as gray-haired and gaunt as the old man was, stood in the center of the room with her hands over her chest.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick glanced around at the wide windows in the front wall of the room as well as one of the side walls. There was too much open space; he could never hope to guard the old man\'92s family there.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The grandson tugged at a heavy rug that covered the floor. \'93Help me!\'94 he cried. \'93There is a hiding place beneath.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Understanding, Darrick grabbed the rug in one hand and yanked, baring the trapdoor beneath the material. Many of the homes along the border where the barbarian tribes often crossed over and raided were constructed with security holes. Families could lock themselves beneath the houses and live for days on the food and water stored there.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The boy\'92s clever fingers found the hidden latch, and the trapdoor popped up.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick slid the sword under the trapdoor\'92s edge and levered it up, revealing the ladder beneath.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The boy took a lantern from the floor and reached for the old woman. \'93Come on, Grandmother.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Ellig,\'94 the old woman whispered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93He would want you to be safe,\'94 Darrick told her. \'93Whatever may come of this.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Reluctantly, the old woman allowed her grandson to lead her into the hiding place.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint279}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint279}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick waited until they were both inside, then closed the trapdoor and dragged the rug back over it. Glass shattered behind him. He rose with the sword in his hand as the lezanti howled in through the broken window and threw itself at him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  There was little room to work with inside the house. Darrick reversed the sword in his right hand, gripping it so that it ran down his arm to his elbow and beyond. He kept his left hand back but ready, allowing his body to follow the line of the sword.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The lezanti reached for him. Darrick swung the sword, not allowing it to drift out beyond his body, keeping it in nice and tight as he\'92d been trained by Maldrin, who had been one of the best Darrick had ever seen at dirty infighting.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick slapped the lezanti\'92s claws to one side with the blade, then whipped his body back the other way, reversing the sword still along his arm, and slashed the creature across the face. The lezanti stumbled back, one hand to its ruined eye and crying out in pain. Darrick stepped in, keeping the sword close, and slashed at the creature\'92s face again. Before it could retreat, he cut the head from its shoulders.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Even as the decapitated head rolled across the hardwood floor, another lezanti crashed through the door, and a third came through the window overlooking the well and the barn.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Breath rasping in his throat but feeling calm and centered, Darrick parried the spear the first creature wielded with surprising skill, caught the spear haft under his left arm, and caught it in his left hand. Holding the spear-carrying lezanti back by holding on to the spear, Darrick wheeled, dropped his sword, turned his hand over, caught the weapon in a regular grip before it fell, and chopped an arm from the other lezanti.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The spear-carrying lezanti shoved forward, trying to drive Darrick backward over a cushioned bench. Darrick pushed the spear out so that the point dug into the wall{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint280}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint280}behind him and halted the lezanti. Releasing the spear, he stepped forward, knowing the one-armed lezanti was closing in on him from behind again. He sliced the lezanti in front of him, shearing its head and one shoulder away, amazed at the sharpness of the sword. With the sword still in motion, he reversed his grip and drove the blade through the chest of the lezanti behind him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Energy crackled along the blade again. Before Darrick could kick the lezanti free of the sword, blue flames erupted from where the blade pierced the creature\'92s chest and consumed it in a flash. Ash drifted to the ground before Darrick\'92s stunned eyes.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Before he could recover, another lezanti hurled itself through the broken window on the barn\'92s side. Darrick succeeded in escaping the fist full of claws the lezanti threw at him but caught the brunt of the creature\'92s charge. He flew backward, stumbling back through the door, unable to get his balance, and landed on the porch. He flipped to his feet as the lezanti charged again. Ducking this time, Darrick slashed the blade across the creature\'92s thighs, chopping both legs off. The lezanti\'92s torso hurtled by overhead and landed in the dirt in front of the porch.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93They\'92re after the sword, Darrick!\'94 Taramis called. \'93Run!\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Even as he realized what the sage said was true, Darrick knew he couldn\'92t run. After losing Mat at Tauruk\'92s Port, and himself for most of the past year, he couldn\'92t run anymore.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Darrick said, rising to his feet. \'93No more running.\'94 He took a fresh grip on the sword, feeling renewed strength flow through him. For the moment, all uncertainty drained away from him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Several of the lezanti tore past the sprawling bodies of the warriors who had fought them. Nearly half of Taramis\'92s group lay on the ground. Most of them, Darrick felt certain, wouldn\'92t rise again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick waited on the charging creatures, lifting the sword high in both hands. Seven of them came at him, getting{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint281}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint281}in one another\'92s way. Energy flickered along the sword\'92s blade. He slashed at his foes as they came into reach, cutting into them, then stepping through the gap that was filled with the swirling ash the mystical flames left behind. Three had died in that attack, but the other four came around again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Regrouping, moving the sword around in his hands as if he\'92d trained with it all his life, Darrick cut at them, taking off a head, two arms, and a leg, then thrusting into two more creatures and reducing them to swirling ash as well. He stepped over to the creatures he had maimed, piercing their hearts with the enchanted blade and watching them burst into pyres that left the ground scorched.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Rallied by Darrick\'92s show of power against the lezantis, the warriors drew up their steel and their courage, and attacked their foes with renewed vigor. The price was high, for men dropped where they stood, but the lezanti died faster. Taramis\'92s and Ellig Barrows\'92s spells took their toll among the demon-forged creatures as well, burning them, freezing them, twisting them into obscene grotesqueries.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick continued battling, drawn by the bloodlust that fired him. It felt good to be so certain and sure of himself, of what he was doing, of what he needed to do. He hacked and slashed and thrust, cleaving through the lezantis that seemed drawn to him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  From the corner of his eye, he saw the lezanti rush toward Ellig Barrows from the side, giving the old man no warning. Knowing he\'92d never reach the old man in time to prevent the creature\'92s attack, Darrick reversed his grip on the sword and threw it like a spear without thinking about what he was doing, as if it were something he\'92d done several times.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sword flashed across the distance and embedded itself in the lezanti\'92s chest. The blade halted the creature, then quivered in its chest as the eldritch scarlet energies gathered again. With a sudden fiery flash, the lezanti crisped to ash. The sword dropped point-first to the ground and stuck.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Out of reflex, Darrick thrust his hand out for the blade.{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint282}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint282}The weapon quivered again, then yanked free of the earth and flew back to his hand.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93How did you know to do that?\'94 Taramis asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Shocked himself, Darrick shook his head. \'93I didn\'92t. It just\'97happened.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93By the Light,\'94 Ellig Barrows said, \'93you were the one destined for Hauklin\'92s sword.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But Darrick remembered Mat\'92s voice in his head. If Mat hadn\'92t been there, somehow, Darrick felt certain that he\'92d never have been able to pick up the weapon. He turned and gazed across the battleground, not believing the carnage that he\'92d somehow survived almost completely unmarked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Come on,\'94 Taramis said, walking to help his men. \'93We can\'92t stay here. Somehow Kabraxis has discovered us. We\'92ve got to leave as soon as we\'92re able.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And then what?\'94 Darrick asked, sheathing the sword in his belt and catching the bag of medicants the sage tossed his way.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Then we make for Bramwell,\'94 Taramis replied over the moans of the wounded warriors. \'93Kabraxis knows we have Stormfury now, and I\'92ve never been one to hide. Besides, now that we have the sword, the demon has every reason to fear us.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Even though he knew the sage\'92s words were meant to be reassuring, and even though the power contained in the sword inspired a lot of confidence, Darrick knew the quest could still take them all to their deaths. The warriors who had fallen today and wouldn\'92t get back up were grim reminders of that. He opened the medicants bag and tried to help those who still lived.

A quarter-mile distant, the church was lighted, festooned with lanterns and torches as worshippers continued their pilgrimage into the structure.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Farther out into the harbor, several ships remained lighted as well. Along with the influx of worshippers wanting to try their luck at getting to walk along the Way of Dreams, smugglers had also seen opportunities to reap financial gain by supplying the populace with black market goods. Guards stayed with the ships during all watches, and it still wasn\'92t unusual for some of them to be attacked and raided by pirates. Thieves picked the pockets of worshippers and robbed them in the alleys.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick lowered the spyglass and rubbed his aching eyes. It had taken the group almost three weeks to reach Bramwell as they journeyed down from the north. It seemed that winter had followed on their heels, blowing in on cold gusts.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Seven men had died at Ellig Barrows\'92s home, and two more had been permanently crippled during the attack of the lezantis and couldn\'92t continue. Seventeen men remained of Taramis Volken\'92s original group of demon hunters.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  And yet Darrick couldn\'92t turn away. There was no fear left in him, and no anticipation, either. For the last three weeks, his father\'92s voice had been inside his head\'97during his waking moments as well as his sleep\'97telling him how worthless he was. His dreams had been nightmares, looping segments of events that had transpired in the small barn behind the butcher\'92s shop. Worst of all had been the memories of Mat Hu-Ring bringing him food and medicines, being there to let Darrick know he wasn\'92t alone\'97yet all the while he had been trapped. Until he had made his escape.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Brush stirred behind Darrick. He shifted slightly, his hand dropping to the hilt of the long sword across his thighs. The blade was naked and ready as he faded into the long shadows of the approaching night.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A dim sunset, a thin slice of ocher and amber, like grapes smeared through pale ale, hung in the west. The last dregs of the day managed to cast a silvery sheen over the harbor, making the ships and boats look like two-dimensional black cutouts on the water. The light barely threaded through the city and seemed not to touch the Church of the Prophet of the Light.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick released his breath slowly so it wouldn\'92t be heard, emptying his lungs completely so he could draw in a full breath if he needed to go into action. The demon hunters had camped within the forest high in the mountains for the last two days and not been disturbed. In the higher reaches where they were, where the cold could reach them, game had been chased up from the foothills by the tent city that had sprung up outside Bramwell and was plentiful.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Maybe it was only a deer, Darrick thought. Then he dismissed the possibility. The sound he\'92d heard had been too calm, too measured.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Tracking the sound of Darrick\'92s voice, Rhambal crept closer. The warrior was a big man but moved as quietly as a woodlands creature through the forest. A square-cut beard framed his broad face, and he had a cut across his nose and beneath his left eye from a lezanti claw that hadn\'92t quite healed during the past three weeks. Exposure to the harsh weather and not being able truly to rest had slowed the healing. Several of the other warriors bore such marks as well.

If it hadn\'92t been for Taramis Volken\'92s leadership, Darrick thought the warriors would have abandoned him or forced him to leave.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Of course, without Taramis Volken, the quest to break into the Church of the Prophet of the Light would have been abandoned. Only Taramis\'92s charisma and his own unflinching courage kept them moving forward.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick had known that the demon hunter had returned. He\'92d watched Taramis come up the mountainside less than an hour before.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93When do we go?\'94 Darrick asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Tonight.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The answer didn\'92t surprise Darrick.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And I for one am ready to do this thing,\'94 Rhambal said. \'93Crossing all this distance from the north and haunted by nightmares the way we\'92ve been, I\'92m ready to get shut of it all one way or another.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick didn\'92t reply. The nightmares had been a constant in all their lives. Even though Ellig Barrows and{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint286}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint286}Taramis had carefully constructed a warding around the group that prevented Kabraxis\'92s scrying on them, they all knew their lives were forfeit if they were caught. The demon had identified them. Several times during the last few weeks, they\'92d barely escaped patrols of warriors as well as herds of demonic-forged creatures that hunted them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The group hadn\'92t been able to escape the nightmares, though. Taramis had said that he was certain the night terrors were inspired by an insidious spell that they hadn\'92t been able to escape. Not a warrior among the group avoided them, and the three weeks of sleepless nights and private hells had taken their toll. A few of the warriors had even suggested that the nightmares were a curse, that they\'92d never be free of them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Palat Shires, one of the oldest warriors among them, had tried to leave the group, unable to bear whatever it was that had haunted him. Darrick had heard whispers that Palat had once been a pirate, and as vicious a killer as any might fear to meet, till Taramis had exorcised the lesser demon that had crawled into Palat\'92s mind from the enchanted weapon he carried and almost driven him insane with bloodlust. Still, even though he knew it had been the demon\'92s possession of him that had caused him to do such horrible things, Palat had never been truly able to forgive himself for the murders and maiming he had committed. But he had sworn himself to Taramis\'92s cause.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Three days after he\'92d left the group, Palat had returned. All knew from his haggard look that he had failed to escape the nightmares. Two days later, in the still hours near dawn, Palat had slashed his wrists and tried to kill himself. Only one of the other warriors, unable to sleep, had prevented Palat\'92s death. Taramis had healed the old warrior as much as he could, then they\'92d holed up for four days to weather out a rain squall and let Palat regain his lost strength.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Come on,\'94 Rhambal said. \'93There\'92s stew still in a pot back there, and Taramis brought up loaves of bread and{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint287}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint287}honeyed butter. There\'92s even a sack of apple cakes because he was in such a generous mood.\'94 A wide grin split the warrior\'92s face, but it didn\'92t get past the fatigue that showed there.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What about a sentry?\'94 Darrick asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We\'92ve been here two nights before this,\'94 Rhambal said. \'93Hasn\'92t anyone come close to us in all that time. There\'92s no reason to think it\'92s going to happen in the next hour.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We\'92re leaving in the next hour?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Rhambal nodded and squinted toward the dimming of the day. \'93As soon as true night hits and before the moon comes into full. Only a fool or a desperate man would be out in the chill of this night.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Reluctantly, because it meant being around the warriors and seeing the damage the harsh journey and the sleepless nights had wrought on them, Darrick stood and crept through the forest, heading higher up the mountainside. The heavy timber blocked most of the north wind that ravaged the mountain.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The campsite was located in a westward-facing cul-de-sac of rock near the peak of the mountain. The cul-de-sac was a small box of stone that stood up from the scrub brush and wind-bent pine trees.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The campfire was that in name only. No flames leapt up around piles of wood to warm the warriors gathered there. Only a heap of orange-glowing coals sheathed amid white and gray ash took the barest hint of the chill away. A pot of rabbit stew sat in the coals and occasionally bubbled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The warriors sat around the campfire, but it was more because there was so little room in the cul-de-sac than out of any vain hope that the coals might stave off the cold. The horses stood at the back of the canyon, their breaths feathering the air with gray plumes, their long coats frosted over. The animals filled the cul-de-sac with the scent of wet horse and ate the long grass that the warriors had harvested for them earlier.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis sat nearest the campfire, his legs crossed under him. The dim orange glow of the coals stripped the shadows{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint288}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint288}from his face and made him look feverish. His eyes met Darrick\'92s, and he nodded in greeting.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Holding his hands out over the coals, the sage said, \'93I can\'92t guarantee you the success of our foray this night, but I will tell you that it is warmer down in Bramwell than it is up on this mountain.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The warriors laughed, but it was more out of politeness than real humor.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Rhambal took a seat beside Darrick, then picked up two tin cups from their meager store of utensils by the campfire. The big warrior dipped both cups into the stew they\'92d made from vegetables and leaves they could find and three unwary hares caught just before sunset. After pulling the cups back from the stewpot, Rhambal dragged a large finger along their sides to clean them, then popped his finger into his mouth.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Despite his fatigue and the feeling of ill ease that clung to him, Darrick accepted the cup of stew with a thankful nod. The warmth of the stew carried through the tin cup to his hands. He held it for a time, just soaking up the warmth, then started to drink it before it cooled too much. The bits of rabbit meat in the stew were tough and stringy.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ve found a way into the church,\'94 Taramis announced.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93A place as big as that,\'94 Palat grumbled, \'93it should be as full of holes as my socks.\'94 He held up one of the socks that he\'92d been drying on a stick near the campfire. The garment was filled with holes.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It is full of holes,\'94 Taramis agreed. \'93A year ago, Master Sayes arrived in Bramwell and began the Church of the Black Road from the back of a caravan. That sprawl of buildings that makes up the church now was built in sections, but it was built well. There are secret passages honeycombing the church, used by Master Sayes and his acolytes, as well as the guards. But the church is well protected.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What about the sewers?\'94 Rhambal asked. \'93We\'92d talked about getting into the building through the sewers.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint289}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint289}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Mercenaries guard the sewer entrances,\'94 Taramis answered. \'93They also guard the underground supply routes into the building.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Then where\'92s this way you\'92re talking about?\'94 Palat asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis took a small, charred stick from the teeth of the dying coals. \'93They built the church too fast, too grand, and they didn\'92t allow for the late-spring flooding. All the building along the shore, including new wells to feed the pools and water reservoirs inside the church, created problems.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sage drew a pair of irregular lines to represent the river, then a large rectangle beside it. He added another small square that thrust out over the river.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Where the church hangs out over the river here,\'94 Taramis continued, \'93offering grand parapets where worshippers can wait to get into the next service and look out over the city as well as be impressed by the size of the church, the river has eroded the bank and undermined the plaza supports, weakening them considerably.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Accepting the chunk of bread smothered in honey butter that Rhambal offered, Darrick listened to Taramis and ate mechanically. His mind was full of the plan that the sage sketched in the dirt, prying and prodding at the details as they were revealed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93One of the problems they had in constructing that parapet that was more vanity than anything else,\'94 Taramis continued, \'93was that the pilings for the parapet had to be laid so that they missed one of the old sewer systems the church had outgrown. Though the church\'92s exterior may look polished and complete, the land underneath hasn\'92t improved much beyond the quagmire it was that persuaded the local populace not to build there.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93So what are you thinking?\'94 Palat asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis gazed at the drawing barely lit by the low orange glow of the coals. \'93I\'92m thinking that with a little luck and the theft of one of those boats out there, we\'92ll have a way into the church tonight as well as a diversion.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Tonight?\'94 Rhambal asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint290}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint290}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sage nodded and looked up, meeting the gaze of every man in front of him. \'93The men I talked to down in Bramwell\'92s taverns this afternoon said that the church services go on for hours even after nightfall.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93That\'92s something you don\'92t always see,\'94 Corrigor said. \'93Usually a man working the field or a fishing boat, he\'92s looking for a warm, dry place to curl up after the sun sets. He\'92s not wanting a church service.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Most church services,\'94 Taramis said, \'93aren\'92t giving away healing or luck that brings a man love or wealth or power.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93True,\'94 Corrigor said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93So we go tonight,\'94 Taramis said. \'93Unless there\'92s someone among us who would rather wait another night.\'94 He looked at Darrick as he said that.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick shook his head, and the other men all answered the same. Everyone was tired of waiting.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We rested up last night,\'94 Rhambal said. \'93If I rest any more, I\'92m just going to get antsy.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Good.\'94 Taramis smiled grimly, without mirth and with perhaps a hint of fear. Despite the sage\'92s commitment to hunting demons and the loss of his family, he was still human enough to be afraid of what they were going to attempt.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then, in a calm and measured tone, Taramis told them the plan.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A light fog shrouded the river, but lanterns and torches along the banks and aboard the ships at anchorage in front of the warehouses and taverns burned away patches of the moist, cottony gray vapor. Men\'92s voices carried over the sound of the wind in the rigging and the loose furls of sailcloth. Other men sang or called out dirty limericks and jokes.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Stone bridges crossed the river in two places, and both of them were filled with people walking from one bank to the other in search of food or drink. Some of the people were tourists, whiling away the time till the church let out and the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint291}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint291}next service began. Others were thieves, merchants, and guardsmen. The prostitutes were the loudest, yelling offers to the sailors and fishermen aboard their boats.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick followed Taramis along the shore toward the cargo ship that the sage had selected as their target.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Blue Zephyr\plain \f2\fs24 was a squat, ugly cargo ship that held the rancid stench of whale oil. Not a sailor worth his salt would want to crew aboard her because she was such a stinkpot, Darrick knew, but she could guarantee a small crew a decent profit for their efforts.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Three men remained on board the small cargo ship. The captain and the rest of the crew had gone into the taverns along Dock Street. But careful observation of the crew revealed that they also had a bottle on board the ship and gathered in the stern to drink it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The thieves and smugglers in Bramwell wouldn\'92t want\plain \f2\i\fs24 Blue Zephyr\'92\plain \f2\fs24 s cargo, Darrick knew. The barrels of whale oil were too heavy to steal easily or escape with from the harbor.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Without breaking his stride, Taramis reached the bottom of the gangplank leading up to the cargo ship. The sage started up the gangplank without pause. Darrick trailed after him, heart beating rapidly in his chest as his boots thudded against the boarding ramp.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The three sailors gathered in the cargo ship\'92s stern turned at once. One of the men grabbed a lantern sitting on the plotting table and shined it toward them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Who goes there?\'94 the sailor with the lantern asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The other two sailors filled their hands with swords and took up defensive positions.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Orloff,\'94 Taramis said, walking toward the men without hesitation.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick split off from the sage, surveying the rigging and deciding in the space of a drawn breath which canvases to use and how best to free them. Only four other men among the sage\'92s warriors had any real experience aboard masted ships, and they all had considerably less than he did.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint292}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint292}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I don\'92t know no Orloff,\'94 the sailor with the lantern said. \'93Mayhap ye got the wrong ship there, mate.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92ve got the right ship,\'94 Taramis assured the man. He closed on them, walking with a confident gait. \'93Captain Rihard asked me to drop by with this package.\'94 He held up a leather-covered bottle. \'93Said it would be something to warm you up against the night\'92s chill.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I don\'92t know no Cap\'92n Rihard,\'94 the sailor said. \'93Ye got the wrong ship. Ye\'92d best be shovin\'92 off.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But by that time, Taramis was among them. He sketched an eldritch symbol in the air. The symbol flared to emerald-green life and flickered out of existence.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Before the last of the color died away, a shimmering wall of force exploded toward the three sailors and knocked them all over the stern railing, scattering them like leaves before a fierce gust. The sailor carrying the lantern hung on to it, arcing out over the river and falling like a comet from the heavens till he disappeared into the water with a loud splash.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  At the same time, signaled by the spell Taramis had used, Rhambal set fire to the oil-soaked exterior of one of the larger warehouses on the south side of the river to create a diversion. Flames blossomed up the side of the warehouse, alerting dozens of people living in the surrounding neighborhood. In seconds, even as the three sailors were knocked from\plain \f2\i\fs24 Blue Zephyr\'92\plain \f2\fs24 s stern, the hue and cry about the fire filled the streets and the banks on both sides of the river.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  When the sailors surfaced, they didn\'92t gain much support for their troubles. Palat joined Taramis in the stern, an arrow to bowstring and the fletchings pulled back to his ear. The sailors got the message and swam for the riverbank.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Get those sails down,\'94 Darrick ordered. Now that they were into the action, with little chance of turning back, his blood sang in his veins. Apart of him came back alive after a year of trying to deaden it. He remembered times past when he and Mat had scrambled aboard a ship to prepare for battle or respond to a surprise attack.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint293}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint293}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The four warriors with sailing experience split up. One went to the stern to take the wheel, and the others scrambled up the rigging.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick climbed the rigging like a monkey, all the moves coming back to him even though it had been months since he\'92d last climbed in a sailing ship. Hauklin\'92s mystic sword banged against his back as he climbed. The cutlass had been short enough that he\'92d kept it sheathed at his side, but the long sword felt more natural slung across his shoulder.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  As he climbed the rigging and reached the furled sails, he slashed through the neatly tied ropes with his belt knife. His sailor\'92s soul resented the loss of the rope, always a prized commodity of a ship at sea, but he knew they\'92d have no further use of it. Thinking like that made him remember what Taramis had in store for the cargo vessel, and that made Darrick even sadder. The small ship wasn\'92t much, but she was seaworthy and had a purpose.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  At the top of the mast, all the sails cut loose below him, Darrick gazed down at the deck.

For the most part they were ignored. The fire at the warehouse was more important because if it spread, the city might be in danger.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Watching the flames blaze, stretching long tongues into the sky above the warehouse, while he tied the sails fast, Darrick knew he couldn\'92t have given the order to fire the building as Taramis had. The people who owned the warehouse had done nothing wrong, nor had the people who stored their goods there.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Darrick,\'94 Taramis called from the ship\'92s stern. He\'92d taken off his outer coat, revealing the orange Vizjerei robes with the silver mystic symbols.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye,\'94 Darrick replied, finishing the last lashing and glancing around at the other warriors working on the canvas. They had been slower at it than he had, but it was all done. \'93You\'92re clear.\'94 He glanced at the other men again. \'93Stand ready, boys. This is going to be a quick bit of work if we can pull it off.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis spoke, and the words he used sounded like growls. No human throat was meant to use the phrases, and Darrick was certain that the sage\'92s spell was from some of the earliest magic that had been brought into the world by the demons among the Vizjerei. Some mages and sorcerers believed that spellcraft was purer when used in the old language it had first been taught in.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A wavering reflection of the warehouse fire spread over the choppy surface of the river. Other glowing dots spread along the banks reflected on the river, too. More were in a straight line under the second bridge that lay between the cargo ship and the church. Hoarse shouts drifted, trapped and held close to the water as sound always was. A bucket brigade had started near the warehouse.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Despite his readiness, Darrick was almost knocked from his feet as Taramis\'92s spell summoned a wild wind from the west. The canvas popped and crackled overhead as the sails filled. Her sails filled with the magically summoned wind, and the ship started forward, cutting through the river against the current.

The sudden action caught three of the warriors unprepared, and they fell onto the deck. The oil kegs overturned and rolled, creating a brief hazard till the ship\'92s keel came up. One of the warriors almost rolled through the open space in the railing where the boarding ramp had fallen away, but he managed to stop himself just short of it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \'93Hold what you\'92ve got!\'94 Darrick cried out over the roaring wind to the other warriors manning the sails. He strained to hang on to the ropes, keeping the sail full into the wind. Little work was necessary on the part of the ship-trained men, though. Taramis\'92s wind caught the cargo vessel squarely and sped her across the river.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Other nearby ships rocked at anchor, and small sailcraft that had been used to ferry goods across the river were blown down, their sails lying in the water.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Wheel!\'94 Darrick yelled, watching as\plain \f2\i\fs24 Blue Zephyr\plain \f2\fs24 closed with frightening quickness on a low barge.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye,\'94 Farranan called back.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Hard to starboard,\'94 Farranan replied.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Immediately, the cargo ship came about. The port-side hull rubbed along the low-slung barge, coming up out of the river slightly and cracking timbers. Darrick hoped most of the cracking timbers belonged to the barge.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hanging on to the ropes tied to the sail, he watched as the corner of the barge went under the cargo ship, the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint296}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint296}prow of the boat and the other corner coming clear of the water. Boxes and crates and longshoremen spilled into the water. Two lanterns dropped into the river as well, both of them extinguishing as soon as the water touched the flames.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then the cargo ship was past the barge, running free through the channel in the middle of the river. The others ships were packed so close together that there wasn\'92t much space to navigate between them. Darrick saw the surprised faces of several sailors peering over taller ships down at the small cargo vessel.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Break that oil open,\'94 Taramis ordered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The warriors broke the oil kegs open with hand axes, spilling the dark liquid across the prow deck. The whale oil ran thick and slow, like blood from a man almost bled out.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  When the cargo ship passed under the bridge that marked the boundary of the last harbor area, Darrick glanced up in time to see Rhambal throw himself over the side of the bridge. The warrior made a desperate grab for the rigging as it passed, caught hold of it and slammed back into the web of rope, then tossed himself into the nearest sail and slid down to the deck. He landed hard and on his back.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Are you all right?\'94 Darrick asked, offering a hand as the wind roared around them and the ship\'92s deck pitched.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Nothing wounded but my pride,\'94 Rhambal said, taking Darrick\'92s hand. The warrior clambered to his feet and winced. \'93And maybe my arse.\'94 He looked back at the blazing warehouse. \'93Now, that\'92ll be enough of a diversion.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Provided we get over into the pilings that Taramis was talking about,\'94 Rhambal said.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick felt\plain \f2\i\fs24 Blue Zephyr\plain \f2\fs24 lunge in response, cutting back{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint297}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint297}toward the northern riverbank where the imposing monolith of the Church of the Prophet of the Light stood. The parapet stood out over the river less than three hundred yards away, and the distance was closing fast. Two pillars of square-cut blocks held the parapet twenty feet up from the river surface, allowing for the rising current during the flood season.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  On both sides of the river, torches and lanterns trailed\plain \f2\i\fs24 Blue Zephyr\'92\plain \f2\fs24 s passage, marking the passage of the city guards. Church guards filled the parapet as the cargo ship sailed within a hundred yards of the overhang. Several of them had crossbows, and the air filled with quarrels.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Take cover!\'94 Palat squalled, ducking down and behind the cargo hold amidships. Quarrels slapped into the deck around him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick heard the missiles whistle by his head within inches of striking him. He pulled himself behind the center mast, trusting the magical winds that Taramis had stirred up to drive\plain \f2\i\fs24 Blue Zephyr\plain \f2\fs24 into the pilings. Overhead, more quarrels ripped through the canvas sails.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Hold the wheel!\'94 Darrick commanded, gazing back at the stern.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Farranan had ducked down, trying desperately to take cover. The weak grip he kept on the wheel allowed the ship to glide back toward the center of the river channel.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Throwing himself from the mast, Darrick charged toward the ship\'92s stern. His back and shoulders tightened up as he ran across the heaving deck, expecting to feel the unforgiving bite of a steel arrowhead at any moment. Grabbing the stairwell railing, he hurled himself up the short flight of steps, almost stumbling over Farranan in his haste.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis stood at the railing. \'93Get back from the prow!\'94 he yelled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick grabbed the wheel and pulled hard to port, bringing the cargo ship back on course. The winds continued unabated, whipping the rigging and tearing the canvas where the quarrels had ripped through. The wheel{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint298}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint298}jerked in Darrick\'92s hands as the rudder fought the river current and the mystical winds.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  After inscribing a glowing seven-pointed symbol in the air, Taramis spoke a single word. Activated by the magic, the symbol spun the length of the deck and ignited the whale oil spilled over the prow. The dark liquid went up in a liquid\plain \f2\i\fs24 whoosh!\plain \f2\fs24 of twisting yellow and lavender flames.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A wall of heat washed back over Darrick, causing him to squint against it. Panic filled him for a moment when he realized he could no longer see the parapet because of the whirling mass of flames and flying embers. Leaping into the rigging and catching the first sail, the fire climbed the forward mast like a lumbering bear cub, testing each new resting place, then diving upward again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He looked up, thinking for one insane moment that he could chart by the stars.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Instead, he spotted the tall bell tower atop the tallest part of the Church of the Prophet of the Light. He aimed the ship by the bell tower, figuring out where it was in relation to the parapet.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Hold what you have,\'94 Taramis said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick nodded grimly.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Quarrels continued to fall onto the ship, sinking deep into the wood. Another caromed from the ship\'92s wheel in Darrick\'92s hands and bit into his left side. For a moment he thought his ribs had caught fire, then he glanced down and saw the quarrel lodged there.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Sickness twisted Darrick\'92s stomach as he thought the shaft had penetrated his stomach or chest. Then he noticed that it had taken him low, skimming across his ribs with bruising force but not biting into muscle or an organ. The quarrel would probably have gone on through if it hadn\'92t been for his traveling cloak.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Steeling himself, Darrick reached down and pulled the quarrel through his own flesh and tossed it over the side. His fingers gleamed crimson with his own blood.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Look out!\'94 Palat yelled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  For one frozen moment, Darrick saw the thick pilings{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint299}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint299}supporting the parapet before him.\plain \f2\i\fs24 We\'92re too high\plain \f2\fs24 , he thought, realizing the cargo ship came up higher on the structure than they\'92d guessed.\plain \f2\i\fs24 The impact is going to turn us away.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But he had forgotten about the sheer, unstoppable tonnage the wild winds drove before them. As cargo ships went, not many were loaded more compactly or more heavily than oil freighters.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Blue Zephyr\plain \f2\fs24 was loaded to the top with driving weight and powered by a whirling storm.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The ship slammed into the pilings, driving from their moorings against the riverbed, collapsing the parapet in a sudden stream of rubble, driving a wall of water up and into the swirling winds so that a sudden monsoon rained down.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Blue Zephyr\'92\plain \f2\fs24 s starboard side took a beating as rock fell from above. Shudders ran the length of the ship, feeling like monstrous blows from a blacksmith\'92s hammer.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Blue Zephyr\plain \f2\fs24 was the anvil, and just as unrelenting and uncompromising. Rock and rubble bounced from the deck, which was canted hard to starboard as it scraped along the exposed riverbank.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The church\'92s guards fell amid the rubble as well. Darrick watched them fall, some of them dropping into the foaming river current on the starboard side of the ship and others bouncing across the deck, caught up in an avalanche of stone and mortar. Two of the guards fell into the flaming canvas on the forward mast. They screamed and dove from the rigging, candle flames burning brightly till they plunged into the river.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Releasing the wheel, knowing he could no longer attempt to hold it in place without risking dire injury, Darrick stepped back and seized the railing. He held on as the ship battled the wind and the riverbank. Pulling himself along the railing, he reached up for a ratline running to stern, caught it, and forced his way to the port side.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Blue Zephyr\plain \f2\fs24 ground to a halt on rock.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick heard the rock scraping along the ship\'92s hull, giant\'92s teeth worrying at a bone. He winced as he realized the amount of damage they\'92d done to the vessel and the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint300}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint300}countless hours of work it would take to get her seaworthy again. He gazed over the deck, wondering if, after all they\'92d risked, they\'92d accomplished what they set out to do.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Shadows clung to the fallen debris and the dark mud of the riverbank. Darrick searched the riverbed but didn\'92t see the threatened sewer system Taramis\'92s research had turned up. Still, despite the grimness of their situation, no real fear touched Darrick. All he felt was an anxiety and a hope that the desperate madness of guilt of the last year would soon be over. Kabraxis\'92s church guards wouldn\'92t let them live after the assault.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis joined Darrick at the railing. The sage spoke a word and pointed to the torch he held. Flames instantly wreathed the torch, and light glared down over the ship\'92s side.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93That torch is going to light us up for the crossbowmen,\'94 Farranan said as he stood at the railing.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We can\'92t stay here,\'94 Rhambal said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Blue Zephyr\plain \f2\fs24 continued to rub and buck against the exposed limestone of the riverbed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The ship\'92s not going to be here for long, either,\'94 Darrick said. For the first time he noticed the quiet that was left after the storm winds had died away. \'93The current\'92s going to dislodge us, sweep us away.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Thrusting the torch out, Taramis scanned the riverbank. More rock dropped from the broken parapet.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93They\'92ve got a boat in the water,\'94 Palat warned.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Looking over the stern railing, Darrick saw a guard ship streaking for them. Lanterns lighted Lord Darkulan\'92s flag in the stern and on the prow, marking the vessel for all to see.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The torch is too weak,\'94 Taramis said. \'93But it\'92s got to be down there.\'94 He waved the torch, reaching down as far as he could, but it was futile. The light simply wouldn\'92t reach the riverbank properly.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Draw the sword,\plain \f2\fs24 Mat Hu-Ring said into Darrick\'92s mind.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Mat?\'94 Darrick whispered. The guilt returned full blast, disrupting the peace he thought he\'92d have when it became{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint301}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint301}apparent there would be no escape. Accepting his own death was far easier than accepting Mat\'92s.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Draw the sword,\plain \f2\fs24 Mat repeated, sounding far away.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Turning, knowing he wasn\'92t going to find his friend standing somewhere behind him the way it sounded, Darrick looked at the warriors assembling in the stern, looking toward Taramis to call their next move.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  The sword, ye damned fool!\plain \f2\fs24 Mat said.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Draw the bloody great sword. It\'92ll help ye an\'92 them with ye.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick reached over his right shoulder, feeling the pain along his left side where the quarrel had gone through, and gripped the hilt of Hauklin\'92s sword. A tingle ran through his hand, and the sword seemed to spring into his grip. He held the weapon before him, a huge gray bar of sharpened steel bearing battle scars.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis and the other warriors holding lanterns and torches they\'92d gotten from the whale-oil freighter tried to penetrate the shadows covering the riverbank.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Maybe if someone goes down there,\'94 Rhambal suggested.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93A man going down there ain\'92t gonna be with the ship if it leaves,\'94 Palat said. \'93We might need to stick with this old scow if we\'92re going to make it out of here.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Be better off trying our luck in the streets,\'94 Rhambal said. \'93Even if we made it out into the harbor without being closed in, they\'92d run us down. We don\'92t have a seasoned crew working the sails and ropes.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Call out the sword\'92s name,\plain \f2\fs24 Mat ordered.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Mat,\'94 Darrick whispered, hurting inside as if he\'92d just witnessed his friend\'92s death. He wasn\'92t imagining Mat\'92s voice. It was real. It was real, and it was inside his head.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint302}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint302}\plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93How do I call on the sword?\'94 Darrick asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What is the sword\'92s name?\'94 In all the confusion, Darrick suddenly couldn\'92t remember.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Stormfury,\plain \f2\fs24 Mat replied.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Are you alive?\'94 Darrick said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  We ain\'92t got time to go into that now. We\'92re hard up against it now, an\'92 there\'92s still Kabraxis to contend with.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The freighter scraped rock again, shifting more violently than ever. For a moment, Darrick thought the vessel had torn free.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Stormfury,\'94 Darrick said, holding the hilt in both hands and not knowing what to expect. The unaccustomed tingle flared through his hands again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  In an eyeblink, a cold blue light ran the length of the sword blade. As lacking as it was in heat, though, the light was bright but colored so that it didn\'92t hurt the eyes.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The magical light given off by the blade cut through the darkness swaddling the riverbank with ease. Blue highlights reflected on the river water pouring into the broken section of the eight-foot sewer system that ran under the church. The ship\'92s collision with the riverbank had sheared away the parapet and the mud, revealing the sewer tunnel and cracking it open.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93There it is,\'94 Taramis said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick whispered, \'93Mat.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  There was no answer, only the whistling sound of the normal breeze moving through the rigging.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The whale-oil freighter bucked again, sliding four or five feet backward and almost coming free of the rocks.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93We\'92re losing the ship,\'94 Taramis said. \'93Move! Now!\'94 He stepped over the railing and threw himself at the riverbank, leading the way.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Go!\plain \f2\fs24 Mat whispered in Darrick\'92s mind, sounding farther away than ever.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Trapped, wanting to know more about how Mat was able to talk to him, thinking perhaps his friend was actually alive somewhere, Darrick climbed the railing and{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint303}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint303}stepped over as the freighter shifted once more, turning slightly as the river current caught it. Another good shove like that by the current, and Darrick knew the ship would twist free. Stepping off the ship, he threw himself forward.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick landed in the mud, sinking his boots up past the ankles, losing his footing and sliding out of control, ending up facedown in the cold muck. The river current washed over him, drenching him and chilling him to the bone. In contrast, the wound in his side burned as if he\'92d been jabbed with a red-hot poker.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The other warriors leapt after him, landing in the mud for the most part, but the last few landed in the river and were nearly washed away in the current before the others helped them. For a moment as they gathered themselves,\plain \f2\i\fs24 Blue Zephyr\plain \f2\fs24 acted as a defensive wall. Quarrels thunked into the ship\'92s side from the guard ship that closed on them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  In the space of the next drawn breath, the burning ship twisted once more and was gone, following the river current. The ship full of guards managed to avoid the bigger ship, but the wash left by its passing and their efforts to get out of the way caught them and nearly capsized them. Then the freighter was by them, plunging downriver toward the ships lying at anchor, promising all manner of destruction before morning saw Bramwell again.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Damnation,\'94 Palat swore. \'93We\'92re like to burn this unfortunate town down around its ears while we\'92re trying to save it tonight.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93If it happens,\'94 Taramis said, \'93the people here would be better served if it were humans doing the rebuilding instead of demons.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Slipping and sliding, Darrick followed the sage into the sewer tunnel. He only noted then that his sword had dimmed, leaving Taramis\'92s torch and the lanterns and torches carried by the other warriors.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sewer was halfway submerged from the problems Taramis had found out about during his foray through Bramwell\'92s taverns. The collision with the freighter had{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint304}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint304}broken through the wall as Taramis had planned, but the extent of the damage was greater than what Darrick would have believed possible. Water poured through cracks in the mortared brick wall wide enough to fit the fingers of a man\'92s hand, sluicing in to join the waist-high deluge that rapidly deepened. Moss and slime grew on the sewer walls, and muck clung to the stone floor beneath the rancid-smelling water.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis halted in the middle of the wide sewer, glancing to the left and the right.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Which way?\'94 Palat asked, raking an arm over his face to clear the water and mud. Smears streaked his features.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93To the left,\'94 Taramis said, and turned in that direction.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  To the right,\plain \f2\fs24 Mat said in Darrick\'92s ear.\plain \f2\i\fs24 If ye go to the left, ye will be caught.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis waded through the rising water.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hesitant, not truly trusting that Mat was speaking to him, knowing that he could have gone insane and never noticed it until now, Darrick said, \'93You\'92re going the wrong way.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis halted in water that was now chest deep. He peered at Darrick. \'93How do you know?\'94 the sage asked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick didn\'92t answer.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Shouts outside the sewer system echoed inside the tunnel, carried flat and hard across the water. Torchlight neared the break, and Darrick knew it wouldn\'92t be long before the guards attacked them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Because Mat is telling me which way to go,\'94 Darrick said.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye,\'94 Darrick replied, knowing he wouldn\'92t have believed his story if he\'92d been the one it was being told to. He could scarcely believe it now.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93How?\'94 Taramis asked.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What do you think?\'94 Palat asked Taramis, taking a half-step in front of the sage to separate him further from Darrick.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Aware of the big warrior\'92s cautionary measure, Darrick remained silent and understood. He would have thought he was mad as well if he hadn\'92t been the one hearing Mat\'92s voice.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis held his torch higher. The flames licked at the stones overhead, charring the moss and lichens that grew there. \'93Every time a demon is loosed into the world of men,\'94 he quoted, \'93the balance must be kept. A way will be made, and only human choice can rid the world of the demon again.\'94 He smiled, but there was no mirth in the expression. \'93Are you certain of this, Darrick?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Aye.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Rhambal pointed his lantern at the wall. \'93We\'92ve got no choice about moving. Those damned guards are going to be on top of us in no time. And most of them are honest men, men just getting paid for enforcing the peace. I don\'92t want to hang around and fight them if I can help it.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis nodded. \'93To the right, then.\'94 He led the way, pushing his torch before him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sewer channel gradually headed up. Darrick felt the incline more because the inrushing water flooded around him and made him more buoyant, which made walking up the hill harder than it should have been. Gradually, though, the water level dropped, and Taramis\'92s torchlight reflected in hundreds of eyes before them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Rats,\'94 Rhambal said, then swore.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The rats occupied the sides of the sewer, shifting and slithering against one another, islands and clots of rat flesh. Their hairless tails flipped and wriggled as they moved constantly.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint306}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint306}
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The rising water lapped over the sides of the sewer tunnel, lifting small groups of tightly clustered rats free of their temporary retreat. Riding the crest of the water as it ebbed and flowed, the rats fixated on the warriors in the tunnel.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  And in the next moment, they attacked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Buyard Cholik rode the stone snake\'92s head back to the wall as guards circulated through the crowd. The confluence of whispered voices created a din in the cathedral that made it impossible to talk.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Someone attacked the church.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The thought pounded through Cholik\'92s mind. He didn\'92t know who could dare such a thing. During the last month, the relationship with Lord Darkulan had become even better. Ties and agreements were beginning to be made to erect a church in Westmarch. The Zakarum Church was fighting politically to disallow the Church of the Prophet of the Light entrance to the capitol city, but Cholik knew it was only a matter of time before even that resistance went away. Through Lord Darkulan and his own observers, many of whom Cholik had entertained in the church during the last month with Lord Darkulan\'92s help, the king had learned how much wealth the hopeful pilgrims brought to Bramwell.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But even beyond the basic wealth that the church could bring to Westmarch, there was no doubt about the miracles. Or about the man who made them happen. With more people coming to the church, Cholik had begun doing more services. He now conducted six from dawn until after dusk. A normal man, Cholik knew, a simply human man, would have dropped in his tracks from the demands, but he had reveled in them, meeting them and surpassing them. Kabraxis had given Cholik his strength, shoring him up and keeping him going.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  More miracles had been worked, all of them received by those fortunate enough to be chosen to journey along the Way of Dreams. During the past months, the size and{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint307}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint307}number of the miracles had increased along with the number of services. Health had been restored. Crooked limbs had been straightened. Wealth had been given. Love had been granted. Husbands and sons who had gone missing in battles had emerged from the gaping, flaming jaws of the stone snake, called from wherever they had been to the path of the Black Road. Those survivors had no memories of where they had been until the moment they stepped from the snake\'92s mouth into the cathedral.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  And three times, youth had been restored to aging parishioners.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  That had all of the coastal cities along the Gulf of Westmarch talking as the story was carried by ship from port to port. Caravans picked up the stories in the port cities and carried them to the east, to Lut Gholein and possibly across the Twin Seas to Kurast and beyond.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Giving the youth back to the three men was the most difficult, Cholik knew, and required great sacrifice. Kabraxis made the sacrifice, but the demon didn\'92t pay the price himself. Instead, Kabraxis took children from the city during the nights and sacrificed them on the Black Road, robbing them of their years so he could reward the parishioners he\'92d chosen with extended years. All three of those parishioners were men who could help the Church of the Prophet of the Light grow and earn the favor of the king. One of them, in fact, had been one of the king\'92s own observers, a man\'97Lord Darkulan insisted\'97who was like a father to the king.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  It was a time of miracles. Everyone in Bramwell spoke of the Church of the Prophet of the Light that way. Health, wealth, love, and a return to youth\'97there was nothing more a man could hope for in life.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But someone had dared attack the church.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Deep anger resonated inside Cholik as he gazed out over the filled cathedral. One of the lesser priests Cholik had groomed stepped forward into the lighted area below.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Brothers and sisters,\'94 the priest said, \'93beloved of Dien-Ap-Sten, join me now in prayer to our magnificent{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint308}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint308}prophet. Wayfinder Sayes goes to speak on your behalf to our prophet and ask that only a few more miracles be granted before we take leave of this service.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  His words, amplified by the specially constructed stage, rolled over the church audience and quieted the whispering that had resulted from the news about the attack on the church.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Threaten to take away their chances at a miracle for themselves,\plain \f2\fs24 Cholik mused\plain \f2\i\fs24 , and you get the attention of every person in the room.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The priest guided the assembly in prayers to Dien-Ap-Sten, singing of the prophet\'92s greatness, goodness, and generousness.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Once the snake\'92s head was again locked into place on the wall and had become immobile, the flames died away, and that section of the cathedral darkened. Many worshippers screamed out Dien-Ap-Sten\'92s name then, begging that the prophet return and grant more miracles.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik stepped from the platform on the snake\'92s back onto the third-floor balcony. A guard hidden in the shadows pulled the heavy drapes back and opened the door for him. Two crossbowmen stood behind the drapes at all times, relieved every hour during the times of service.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Stepping through the door into the hallway beyond, Cholik found a dozen members of his personal guard waiting for him. No one used this hallway except him, and it led to the secret passageways that had been honeycombed throughout the church. They held lanterns to light the darkened hallway.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What is going on?\'94 Cholik demanded, stopping among them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The church has been attacked, Wayfinder,\'94 Captain Rhellik reported. He was a hard-faced man, used to commanding mercenaries and waging small, hard-won wars or tracking bandits.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I knew that,\'94 Cholik spat. \'93Who has dared attack my church?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Rhellik shook his head. \'93I\'92ve not yet learned, Wayfinder.{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint309}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint309}From what I\'92ve been told, a ship smashed into the courtyard south of the church that overhung the river.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93An accident?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No, Wayfinder. The attack on the parapet was deliberate.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Why attack the courtyard there? What could they possibly hope to gain?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I don\'92t know, Wayfinder.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik believed the mercenary captain. When Rhellik had been brought to the church almost a year ago, he\'92d been dying a paraplegic, paralyzed from the neck down by a horse stepping on him during a battle with bandits while traveling from Lut Gholein. His men had bound him to a litter and brought him almost two hundred miles for healing.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  At first, Cholik had seen no value in the mercenary captain, but Kabraxis had insisted that they watch him. For weeks, Rhellik had stayed at every service, fed by his men and bathed in the river, and he had sung praises to Dien-Ap-Sten as best as he was able with his failing voice. Then, one day, the snake\'92s head had lifted him from the crowd and gulped him down. A few minutes after that, the mercenary captain had walked back from the Way of Dreams, hale and hearty, and he had pledged his service forever to the prophet Dien-Ap-Sten and his Wayfinder.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It doesn\'92t make any sense,\'94 Cholik said, starting down the hallway.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No, Wayfinder,\'94 Rhellik agreed. He raised the lantern he carried in one hand to light their way. He carried his vicious curved sword in the other hand.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93None of these people has been identified?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93How large is the force that attacked the church?\'94 Cholik demanded.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No more than a couple dozen warriors,\'94 Rhellik said. \'93The city guards tried to turn them.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The boat had to sail upriver to crash into that parapet.\'94 Cholik turned and followed the passageway to his right,{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint310}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint310}going up the short flight of steps. He knew every hallway in the church. His robes swished as he hurried. \'93It couldn\'92t have been going fast. Why didn\'92t the city guards stop it?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The ship was driven by magic, Wayfinder. They had no chance to stop it.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93And we don\'92t know who these people are?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I regret to say, Wayfinder, that we don\'92t. As soon as that changes, I\'92ll let you know.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Only a little farther on, Cholik reached the hidden door that opened into one of the main hallways on the fourth floor. He released the lock and stepped out into the hallway.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  No one was in the hallway. No visitors were allowed up from the first and second floors where seating was made available in the cathedral. And none of the staff who lived there was in those rooms because they were all attending the service. The south fourth-floor wing was reserved for acolytes who had been with the church for six months or longer. It was surprising how quickly those small rooms had filled.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik turned to the left and walked toward the balcony that overlooked the parapet courtyard at the river\'92s edge below.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Wayfinder,\'94 Rhellik said uncomfortably.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What?\'94 Cholik snapped.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Perhaps it would be better if you allowed us to protect you.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Protect me?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93By taking you to one of the lower rooms where we can better defend you.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You want to hide me away?\'94 Cholik asked in exasperation. \'93At a time when my church is attacked, you expect me to hide away like some coward?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92m sorry, Wayfinder, but it would be the safest course of action.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The mercenary\'92s words weighed heavily on Cholik\'92s thoughts. He had sought out Kabraxis with his mind, but the demon was nowhere to be found. The situation irritated and{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint311}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint311}frightened him. As big as the church was, there was nowhere for him to go if he\'92d been targeted by assassins.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Cholik said. \'93I am guarded by Dien-Ap-Sten\'92s love for me. That will be my buckler and my shield.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes, Wayfinder. I apologize for doubting.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Doubters do not stay in the grace of the Prophet of the Light for long, captain. I would have you remember that.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Of course, Wayfinder.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik strode up the final flight of steps to the balcony. The night wind whipped over him. There was no sign of the mystical winds of which Rhellik had spoken. But Cholik\'92s eyes settled on the burning ship loose on the river current.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Flames roiled across the entire length of the ship, twisting and shifting and racing toward the heavens. Swirls of orange and red embers leapt up from the topmost parts of the masts and rigging, dying in their suicidal race to reach the night sky. In the next moment, the ship rammed into one of the vessels anchored in the river harbor, catching the other ship broadside.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A shower of embers and flying debris from the sails blew over the line of ships beyond the two that remained locked together. Torches and lanterns marked the sailors running to deal with the fire and save the ships. As tightly packed as they were, the fire would spread rapidly if it remained unchecked.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik glanced upriver, spotting the guards at the base of the river where the hanging courtyard had been torn away. He watched in confused speculation as the guards leapt from their craft and waded through the water. Only when their lanterns and torches neared the opening in the sewer did he spot it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93They\'92re inside the sewers,\'94 Cholik said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Rhellik nodded. \'93I have already sent a runner to take some of my men there to intercept them. We have maps of the sewer systems.\'94 His mouth tightened into a grim line. \'93We shall protect you, Wayfinder. You need have no fear.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I have no fear,\'94 Cholik said, turning to address the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint312}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint312}mercenary captain. \'93I am chosen of Dien-Ap-Sten. I am the Wayfinder of the Way of Dreams where all miracles take place. The men who have broken into my church are dead men, whether they know it or not. If they don\'92t die at the hands of the guards or at my own hands, then they will die at the hands of Dien-Ap-Sten. Although generous to his believers, Dien-Ap-Sten is merciless against those who would strike against him.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The guards funneled into the breached sewer tunnel. Their lantern light and torchlight made the opening glow cherry red like a wound gone bad with poisonous infection.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Pass the word along to your men, captain,\'94 Cholik said. \'93I want them to watch for the burned man who attacked me last month.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Yes, Wayfinder. I only pray that no worshipper comes here this night with such an affliction in hopes of being healed. Such a person would find only death waiting.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Cholik stared across the black river. Clusters of lights stood on either bank. More lights raced along the two bridges that connected the north and south sections of the city.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  When the attackers were caught, and Cholik had every reason to believe that they would be, they would be put to death. He\'92d have their heads mounted on pikes at the main entrance through the church walls, and he would say that Dien-Ap-Sten had commanded that it be so, to show the enemies of the Church of the Prophet of the Light that the prophet could be fierce and unforgiving as well. It would temper the faith of those who believed, and it would be a grand story that would bring more people in to see the church and the religion.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A worm of fear crawled through Cholik\'92s heart. Although he had not talked to Kabraxis of the demon hunter, Cholik had read about the man. Taramis Volken had been a powerful force against demons for years. Once he had read and heard some of the stories about the man, Cholik remembered reading about him from the archives in the Zakarum Church. Taramis Volken was viewed as an inflexible man, one who would not quit. The demon hunter had proven that over the last few weeks. Ever since recovering Stormfury, Hauklin\'92s sword, the group had vanished.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But before he could stop himself, Cholik wondered if they were somehow in Taramis Volken\'92s grasp instead. All his training in the Zakarum Church had taught him that demons didn\'92t enter the human world without affecting the balance between Light and Darkness. Taramis Volken had proven himself to be the champion of Light on several occasions.

The pale yellow light of the warriors\'92 lanterns and torches played over the wriggling rat bodies as they raced along the ledges and the uneven walls and swam through the murky water of the sewer mixing with the river encroaching through the break in the tunnel behind them.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Rhambal stood tall and massive at the head of the group. With a backward swipe of his shield, the warrior knocked a dozen of the leaping rats from the air. The thuds of their bodies slamming against the shield echoed in the sewer tunnel.

By the time he\'92d wiped the blood from his face and cleared his vision, three more rats landed on him, staggering him with their sudden weight.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A fierce headache dawned between Darrick\'92s temples, then throbbed with an insane beat that almost dropped him to his knees in the cold water. Black spots swam in his vision.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Use the sword, Darrick,\plain \f2\fs24 Mat insisted.\plain \f2\i\fs24 It can save all of ye.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93What can I do?\'94 Darrick asked.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Believe,\plain \f2\fs24 Mat answered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Struggling, Darrick tried to find the key to make the magic work. It would be better if there were a magic word or something else. All he could remember was how the sword had acted and felt at Ellig Barrows\'92s house, and how the sword had behaved when it lit the riverbank to reveal the tunnel they\'92d clambered through only moments before. It wasn\'92t belief, Darrick knew, but it was something he knew to be true.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sword shivered and glowed blue again. Calm warmth filled the tunnel and soaked into Darrick\'92s flesh and bones as a humming sound filled the air. In stunned amazement, he watched as the blood stopped slipping between Palat\'92s fingers.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hesitantly, Palat removed his hand from Clavyn\'92s neck, revealing the jagged wound that had severed the warrior\'92s jugular. As they watched, the flesh knitted, turning back into seamless flesh with only a small scar left behind.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The humming and the warmth continued, and Darrick watched as even the wounds he\'92d endured healed, including the rip along his ribcage made by the arrow earlier. In less than a minute, the warriors were all healed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Blessed by the Light,\'94 Rhambal said, a childlike grin on his broad face. \'93We\'92ve been blessed by the Light.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Or saved to be killed later,\'94 Palat growled, \'93if you\'92re going to stand there flapping your lips.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick reached for Mat, wanting to hear his voice.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Head buzzing, still filled with the headache, Darrick gazed back along the tunnel.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Flickering light filled the darkness behind them, proof that the guard ship had arrived. Splashing echoed around Darrick and signaled the guards\'92 approach.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Forward,\'94 Taramis ordered, lifting his lantern and moving farther up the sewer.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The group started forward, fighting the water and the sewer\'92s slick stone bottom. The darkness ahead of them retreated before the torches and the lanterns. Darting through the shadows and the water, a few rats shrilled and squeaked at their approach but made no move to attack.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Something thudded into Darrick\'92s side, drawing his attention. He looked down, barely able to spot the short piece of ivory bone that slid through the water. At first, he thought the bone was some sore of creature with a hard carapace, then he saw that it was a leg bone from one of the rats Taramis had slain with his spell.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Hey,\'94 Rhambal called out, reaching down and snatching a small rat\'92s skull from the water. \'93These are the bones of the rats.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Before the big warrior could say any more, the skull leapt from his hand and snapped at his face, causing him to draw back. He swept his armored fist at it, but the skull was gone, dropping back into the water.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Hold,\'94 Taramis said, taking a lantern from one of the nearby warriors and raising it. The light chased the darkness, splintering the shadows and reflecting from the tossed and uneven planes of the water.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Revealed by the lantern light, hundreds of bones slid through the water, flashing greenish white under the light.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93It\'92s the demon\'92s doing,\'94 Palat snarled. \'93The demon knows we\'92re down here.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  In the next instant, a frightening figure surged from{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint320}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint320}beneath the water. The line of warriors closest to it stepped back.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Formed of the rats\'92 bones, the creature stood eight feet tall, built square and broad-chested as an ape. It stood on bowed legs that were whitely visible through the murky water. Instead of two arms, the bone creature possessed four, all longer than the legs. When it closed its hands, horns formed of ribs and rats\'92 teeth stuck out of the creature\'92s fists, rendering them into morningstars for all intents and purposes. The horns looked sharp-edged, constructed for slashing as well as stabbing. Small bones, some of them jagged pieces of bone, formed the demon\'92s face the creature wore.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93That\'92s a bone golem,\'94 Taramis said. \'93Your weapons won\'92t do it much harm.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The bone golem\'92s mouth, created by splintered bones so tightly interwoven they gave the semblance of mobility, grinned, then opened as the creature spoke in a harsh howl that sounded like a midnight wind tearing through a graveyard. \'93Come to your deaths, fools.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis gestured with his free hand, inscribing a mystic symbol. Immediately, the symbol became a pumpkin-sized fireball that streaked for the incredible bone creature.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Striking the bone golem in the chest, the impact of the fireball knocked the creature back on its heels for a moment. Flames wreathed the demon-made thing, crawling through the gaps in the bones till it seemed to be burning on the inside as well. Steam welled out of the bone golem but didn\'92t appear to do any further damage.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Opening its mouth again, the bone golem howled once more, and this time flames spat into the air as well. The ululating wail echoed the length of the sewer, so loud it was deafening. Several of the warriors put their hands to their ears, their mouths open as they screamed in pain.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick never heard the warriors\'92 screams over the spine-chilling roar. But he heard Mat\'92s voice.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  It\'92s up to ye, Darrick,\plain \f2\fs24 Mat said calmly.\plain \f2\i\fs24 The bone golem will kill them if it gets the chance. Only Hauklin\'92s enchanted blade can damage the creature.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint321}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint321}\plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93I\'92m no hero,\'94 Darrick whispered as he looked at the creature.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Perhaps not,\plain \f2\fs24 Mat said,\plain \f2\i\fs24 but there\'92s no place to run.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Glancing back over his shoulder, Darrick saw the line of church guards filling the sewer behind them. Retreat only offered the inevitable battle with the guards and the promise of even more waiting for them out in the harbor.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The warriors drew back beside Darrick, obviously preferring their chances against human foes instead of the bone golem. Darrick stared at the creature, pushing himself through and past his fear. There was no way out except through the bone golem.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  He stepped forward, falling into a defensive position as the creature closed on him. One of the spiked fists slashed at him. Ducking beneath the blow, Darrick set himself and cut upward. Catching the bone golem\'92s arm with the edge of his blade, Darrick tried to cut through the elbow joint. The blow missed by a couple of inches and skidded along the creature\'92s arm.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Sensing his opponent\'92s movement more than he saw it, Darrick dodged backward, narrowly avoiding the balled left fist that streaked for his head. The bone blades jutting from the fist slashed through the chest of his traveling leathers, then splashed into the waist-high water swirling around them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Before the bone golem could draw its arm back, Darrick swung the enchanted blade again. This time the sword sheared through the arm, splintering it into a thousand bone shards and scattering them through the water. The bone golem threw a right fist at Darrick\'92s face that would have carved the face from his skull if it had landed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Desperately, Darrick threw himself backward. The razor edges of the fist slashed across his chest again, cutting through his traveling leathers but scoring on the flesh beneath this time as well. Fear rattled through Darrick, almost causing him to give up hope, but Hauklin\'92s sword felt steady and true in his hands. He parried the bone golem\'92s next blow, turning the huge fist from its target,{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint322}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint322}stepping back as the creature followed the bony hammer into the water and bent double. Spinning, Darrick landed a blow against the bone golem\'92s ribcage beneath the stub of its bottom left arm. Broken bone shards flew in all directions, but the creature remained whole.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Still moving, somehow keeping his footing in the water and in the muck, Darrick retreated, slashing and parrying with Hauklin\'92s sword. Crimson stained the front of his traveling leathers as he bled. While pulling back, he tripped and fell.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The bone golem swiped at Darrick at once, aiming a fist at his face.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then Rhambal was there, blocking the blow with his shield. The razor-sharp spikes that festooned the bone golem\'92s fist tore through the warrior\'92s shield less than a foot from Darrick\'92s face. Getting his feet under him again, Darrick saw the bone golem\'92s spike pierce Rhambal\'92s shield and into the arm that held it. Blood spurted as the bone golem drew its fist free.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  In obvious agony, Rhambal stepped back, then faltered and fell to his knees, clutching his wounded arm to his chest and leaving his head exposed.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Guilt hammered Darrick, more painful than the cuts across his chest.\plain \f2\i\fs24 It\'92s my fault,\plain \f2\fs24 he told himself.\plain \f2\i\fs24 If I hadn\'92t been able to free Hauklin\'92s sword, they would have never come here.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  No,\plain \f2\fs24 Mat said.\plain \f2\i\fs24 They would have come, Darrick. Even without ye an\'92 that sword.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The bone golem wasted no time in setting itself and attacking the new prey it found before it. Gripping the enchanted sword in both hands, Darrick stepped forward and swung. When the blade met the bone golem\'92s arm, the weapon shattered the limb.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Roaring with rage, the bone golem turned its attention back to Darrick, flailing after him with its two remaining arms. Darrick fended one of the blows off, then avoided{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint323}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint323}the other, throwing himself into the air and flipping over the arm.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis and Palat dashed forward, caught Rhambal under the arms, and dragged him back from the bone golem\'92s reach.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Landing on his feet, Darrick blocked another sweeping roundhouse blow, feeling the impact vibrate through his wrists and arms. He almost lost his grip on the sword but clung to it tightly. Running at the wall on the left, knowing if he stopped the bone golem would swarm over him, Darrick threw himself into the air and struck the wall with his water-filled boots. Water splashed out of his boots on impact.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  You\'92re a blight on me, boy,\plain \f2\fs24 his father\'92s voice thundered inside his head.\plain \f2\i\fs24 An embarrassment to me.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The words tumbled through Darrick\'92s mind, splitting his concentration as he cushioned the impact against the wall by bending his knees and falling forward.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Don\'92t listen to him,\plain \f2\fs24 Mat said.\plain \f2\i\fs24 It\'92s only the damned demon talkin\'92 to ye. He\'92s lookin\'92 for yer weak spots, he is. An\'92 yer personal business, why, it\'92s no business of his.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  But Darrick knew that the words didn\'92t just come from the demon. They came from that small stable in back of his father\'92s butcher shop, and they came from years of abuse and cold hatred that he hadn\'92t understood as a child. Even as a young man, Darrick had been powerless to defend himself against his father\'92s harsh words. Maybe his father had learned not to be so quick with his hands when Darrick had started fighting back, but Darrick had never learned to protect himself from his father\'92s verbal assaults and his mother\'92s neglect.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick fell forward on the wall, his forward momentum allowing him to make contact for just an instant before gravity pulled him toward the water-filled tunnel. From the corner of his eye, he saw the bone golem throwing{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint324}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint324}another punch. By the time it reached the wall where he\'92d landed, he had pushed off with one hand\'97the other gripping Hauklin\'92s sword\'97and flipped back toward the tunnel behind his attacker.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The bone golem\'92s fist crunched into the wall, splitting stone and breaking loose mortar that held it together.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick forced his father\'92s words from his mind, stilled his shaking hand, and squared himself as he took a full breath of the fetid air around him. Taking a two-handed grip on the magical blade, watching the bone golem start turning to face him, Darrick saw Taramis and his warriors on the other side of the creature. Beyond them, the church guards awaited an opportunity. Crossbowman fired their weapons, but the quarrels caught on the shields of the men at the rear of the warrior group.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f2\i\fs24  Do it!\plain \f2\fs24 Mat roared in Darrick\'92s head.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sword blazed blue again, a true and cold blue like that found in the sea before the deep turned black. Swinging, not holding anything back, Darrick felt the enchanted weapon shatter through the bone golem\'92s ribcage and grate to a stop embedded in the creature\'92s spine.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The bone golem howled with pain, but its macabre voice carried laughter as well, rolling gales of it. \'93Now you\'92re going to die, insect.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No,\'94 Darrick said, feeling the power tingling through the sword. \'93Go back to hell, demon.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Eldritch blue flames leapt down the length of the sword and curled around the bone golem\'92s spine as it reached for Darrick. The fire grew, enveloping the bone golem and burning away whatever magic bound the skeletal remains of the dead rats together. Flaming bones toppled into the sewer water, hissing when they struck.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  For a moment, everyone\'97including Darrick\'97stood frozen in disbelief.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Turning, Darrick ran, raising his knees high to clear the water level. The sword continued to glow, chasing back the{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint325}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint325}shadows that filled the tunnel. Taramis and the demon hunters came after Darrick.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Less than fifty yards farther on, the tunnel ended at a T juncture. Without hesitation, the sword pulled Darrick to the right. He ran on, filmed by the condensation filling the tunnel as well as perspiration pouring from every pore. His breath burned the back of his throat, and he was convinced the stench of the place was soaking into him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Only a short distance farther on, the tunnel ended without warning. Sometime in distant years past, the sewer had collapsed. The sword\'92s bright blade illuminated the pile of rubble that blocked the passageway. Cloaked in the shadows and the collapse of broken rock, rats prowled the rubbish heap. Hundreds of them scampered and crept along the broken rock.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Above the rubble, a rounded dome of fallen earth peeked through. No longer shored up by the stones, the earth had collapsed inward over the years but had not completely fallen. There was no way to guess how many feet of earth and rock separated the tunnel from the surface.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

Maybe Mat had found a way to keep it quiet, but if he believed that, then Mat couldn\'92t be the demon, and Darrick was pretty certain that the demon inside his head was Mat, too.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen yelped and yanked his hand back. Fresh steam rose from his burned fingers as he retreated into the tunnel above the sewer. He cursed and broke two more rocks free, enlarging the space so the demon hunters could more easily gain entrance.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  After introducing himself, Taramis offered his hand. The pirate captain remained out of arm\'92s reach and ignored the hand. His gaze focused on Darrick. \'93Has your dead friend been in touch with you?\'94 the pirate captain demanded.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Splashing sounded in the sewer below.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Raithen stepped back and pulled a barrel from the wall beside the opening. As he yanked on the heavy barrel, the skin covering his hands split and bled. Crimson stained the barrel as Darrick and Palat lent hands, pushing the barrel toward the opening in the floor. Yanking the lid from the barrel, the pirate captain revealed the dark oil inside.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Together, they poured the contents of the barrel into the sewer water and over the rocks below. Rats scampered from beneath the dark liquid, and the guards held their positions warily.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Two crossbow quarrels flew through the opening in the floor. One of them splintered through the side of the barrel, and the other sliced through Raithen\'92s right calf. Cursing with the pain, Raithen reached back to the wall and yanked a torch from the sconce there. He tossed the torch through the hole in the floor and onto the pile of debris below.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Peering cautiously over the side of the hole, Darrick watched as the oil caught fire. Flames spread over the pile of rubble, chasing the rats from their hiding places and onto the guards and into the water. The oil floating on top of the water caught fire as well. Carried by the slow current of the sewer, flames floated toward the guards, forcing them to retreat.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Stepping out of the hiding place after the sage, Darrick was almost overwhelmed by the cacophony of sound that filled even the huge cathedral. Thousands of voices were lifted in praise of Dien-Ap-Sten, the Prophet of the Light.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Church guards occupied a raised area to the right. All of them spotted the secret door opening. One of the bowmen lifted his weapon and drew an arrow back to his ear. Before the guard could properly aim his shaft, Raithen extended his hand with the crossbow in it and squeezed the trigger. The small bolt left Raithen\'92s weapon and pierced the guard\'92s Adam\'92s apple, nailing it to the back of his throat. The guard toppled from the raised area into the crowd, inciting a small riot and starting a wave of hoarse shouting and screaming.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick battled for his life. Outnumbered as they were at the moment, he knew it was only going to get worse. He parried and riposted, turning a blade aside, then following through behind the point as it sank through the heart of a mercenary. Placing his foot against the dead man\'92s chest, Darrick kicked him backward into three others who rushed to take his spot.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hands moving with grace and speed, Taramis inscribed mystic symbols in the air. At a shouted phrase, the symbols flew toward the cathedral\'92s peaked roof.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A black cloud formed near the high ceiling as Darrick blocked another blade. Holding the weapon trapped, Darrick stepped up and delivered an elbow and a backfist blow to a church guard who had hard pressed Rhambal, who was having trouble due to his wounded arm. The guard dropped in front of Rhambal.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  A blizzard suddenly filled the cathedral, whipping fat snowflakes over the central area as well as the worshippers. The whirling blanket of whiteness made it hard to see, and naked skin burned at the snowflakes\'92 touch like acid.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The demon hunters cleared the area, but not all of the guards got free. Three of the guards were smashed to bloody pulp by the impact. Despite the stone that shattered across the cathedral floor and the chunks that skittered through the pews, the snake wasn\'92t harmed at all.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Gathering his courage, overcoming the doubts that assailed him, Darrick ran toward the snake. Curling in on itself, bloody pieces of the three guards still caught in its fangs, the snake pursued Darrick. Conscious of the unnatural beast closing on him, Darrick cut to the right and hit the ground rolling, sliding up under the snake\'92s own body.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Reaching up, Darrick caught hold of the carved scales with his free hand. The snake head pummeled the cathedral floor, tearing flagstones loose and shattering others. Darrick pushed himself up, clinging to the carved scales along the stone serpent\'92s underside, pulling himself to his feet. He leapt, landing on the snake\'92s snout. Hissing, gurgling flames, the snake opened its mouth, and a forked tongue made of flames stabbed out at him.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The flames singed Darrick\'92s hair as he ran up the snake\'92s snout. Aided by the unnatural beast opening its mouth, Darrick hurled himself into the air toward the platform where Buyard Cholik stood.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Suddenly understanding Darrick\'92s desperate move, Cholik lifted his hands to work his magic. But it was too late. Before the spell was complete, Darrick grabbed the man\'92s robe. Cholik\'92s only saving grace was that Darrick hadn\'92t managed to land on the platform with him.

When his weight hit the end of his arm, Darrick pulled Cholik from his feet, slamming the man against the iron railing and breaking his concentration. Holding on to the robe with one hand, swaying wildly, knowing the snake was curling again, trying to dislodge him and cause him to fall so it could get at him,{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint344}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint344}Darrick flexed his arm, bending his elbow and pulling himself closer to Cholik.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The blizzard swirled around them with blinding intensity. Cold burning his face and exposed skin, buffeted by the storm winds that Taramis had raised with his magic, Darrick drew back his sword, flipped his hand on the hilt, and threw it like a spear.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hauklin\'92s enchanted blade sailed true even in the terrible wind. It pierced Buyard Cholik\'92s heart, causing the man to stumble backward, tripping over the robe that Darrick held so tightly to.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taking advantage of Cholik\'92s inability to fight against him, Darrick caught the edge of the platform in his other hand, then pulled himself up. Cholik stepped backward, freed from Darrick\'92s grip, and fell over the platform\'92s edge.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick recognized the voice as his father\'92s. His eyes snapped open, and he saw the familiar stable area behind his father\'92s butcher shop. He found himself lying on the sour hay that lined the hayloft.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Instinctively, Darrick curled into a ball, trying to protect himself. His body hurt from the beating he\'92d remembered getting the day before. Or maybe it was the same day, only earlier. Sometimes after a beating Darrick had lost track of time. He suffered blackout periods as well as lost time.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  His father slapped him, causing his head to ring with pain.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick took the blow on the back of his head, watched the world spin around him for a moment, and remembered how only last week he\'92d watched his father beat three caravan guards in a fight in the muddy street outside the Lame Goose Tavern. As a butcher, his father was passable, but as a fighter, there were few who could compare.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick cringed inside. He knew there was no winning when his father was in one of his moods. If he had fed the livestock, his father would have found fault with it, would have insisted it was too much or too little. Darrick\'92s stomach lurched as if he were on a storm-tossed sea.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

Other than{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint348}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint348}one of the stories he sometimes overheard outside the taverns his father frequented in the evening. His father always tried to leave Darrick at home, but his mother was seldom there in the evenings, and Darrick had been too afraid to sit at home alone.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  So Darrick had secretly followed his father from tavern to tavern, having an easy time not being seen because his father had been deep in his cups.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick didn\'92t speak. He couldn\'92t. Only a few days ago, using the tricks he\'92d learned from Mat, who had learned them from his uncle the sailor, Darrick had made the rope from scraps of rope left by farmers who brought their animals to his father\'92s shop to be butchered.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  For days Darrick had thought about hanging himself and putting an end to everything.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93You couldn\'92t do it, could you, boy?\'94 his father demanded. He coiled the rope up, shaking the noose out.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick cried and shook. His nose clogged up, and he knew he sounded horrible. If he tried to speak, his father would only make fun of him and slap him to make him speak better, not stopping till Darrick was unconscious or{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint349}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint349}nearly so. He knew he\'92d taste blood for days from the split lips and the torn places inside his cheeks.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Only this time, his father had something different in mind. His father threw the rope over the rafter support on the other side of the hayloft, then caught the noose when it came back down.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  His father fitted the noose over his neck and grinned. His breath stank of sour wine. \'93I think snapping your neck is a coward\'92s way out. I\'92m not going to let no bastard son of mine be afraid of dying. You\'92re going to meet it like a man.\'94

Despite the cold blowing down out of the mountains, the sun\'92s rays chased the night\'92s shadows away from Bramwell and out into the sea.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 Darrick Lang stood atop the garden-covered roof of the Church of the Prophet of the Light as he had all through the long night. He wore his heavy cloak, but the wind cut through it and left him near frozen; still, he wouldn\'92t walk away. His father\'92s voice had rung in his head for hours and had only started to dim a short time ago. Darrick didn\'92t hear Mat\'92s voice at all and didn\'92t know if Mat had continued on through the ghost roads or if he had died yet again during the final confrontation. It was hard not knowing.

Palat had spat blood and told them they were all mad because they\'92d lost easy jobs, and if they wanted to lose more than that, all they had to do was step up. None of the mercenaries had. During the confusion, Raithen had disappeared.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis had kept his group together, fearing retaliation on the part of the stunned crowd. At first, it had looked as if the audience would turn on the demon slayers despite the fact that Darrick had held Kabraxis\'92s head and showed them the lie they had been told. They had been there to witness and receive miracles and had seen all that torn away instead. Some of them had sat in the pews for hours,{\*\bkmkstart RichViewCheckpoint354}{\*\bkmkend RichViewCheckpoint354}in faint hope that the Prophet of the Light and the Wayfinder would return for those who truly believed.

Although he had worked with Taramis and the other demon hunters and had slain both Buyard Cholik and Kabraxis, Darrick knew they still didn\'92t trust him. His path was not theirs; he wouldn\'92t ride off into the new dawn or find a ship out in the harbor to make war against another demon.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The city guard is fighting with roving bands of worshippers in the city,\'94 Taramis said. \'93Many of them are protesting the night\'92s events.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93No, but they want revenge against the city for the guilt and confusion and anger they feel. If Bramwell is lucky, only a few buildings and a few lives will be lost before the guard gets the situation under control.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick reflected on his own dark anger. The emotion was residue from what his father had done to him. He knew that now, but he also knew that residue was indelible and would be with him forever.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick clapped a hand over the sage\'92s side, causing him to wince. Power flowed through Darrick, and for the time it took to work, he heard Kabraxis\'92s whispers more loudly in the back of his mind. He took his hand away. \'93Check the wound.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Hours later, with the sun now in the west out over the ocean and a ship\'92s passage secured, Darrick stood on the Bramwell docks. Taramis and the other demon hunters joined him, agreeing to take at least this much of the voyage together.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The docks were congested, people milling around like cattle being herded onto cargo ships. The waves pressed the ships up against the dock pilings, causing sonorous booms to echo over the dockyards.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Without warning, a woman\'92s shrill scream punctuated the noise.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Halfway up the gangplank leading onto the ship he\'92d booked passage on, Darrick turned and looked back.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Men hauled a young girl from the water, her body torn and shattered in her long dress.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  An older woman, probably her mother, knelt beside the little girl as the sailors stretched her out on the docks. \'93Please,\'94 the woman begged. \'93Can someone help my little girl? Is there a healer here?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93A healer wouldn\'92t do that one any good,\'94 a gruff sailor beside Darrick said. \'93That little girl had the ill luck to fall between the ship an\'92 the pilin\'92s as she was boardin\'92. Smashed her up inside. Ain\'92t nobody gonna be able to do anything about that. She\'92s dead, just waitin\'92 for it to come callin\'92.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick looked at the frail girl, her body busted up from the impact, drenched and in horrible pain.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Darrick,\'94 Taramis said.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  For a frozen moment, Darrick remained on the boardwalk. What if the little girl\'92s accident was no accident? What if it was a temptation arranged by Kabraxis to use the healing power again? What if someone in the crowd, a traveling Vizjerei or another wizard, recognized that Darrick\'92s power wasn\'92t given by the Light but from a demon spawn from the Burning Hells?
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then Darrick was moving, vaulting from the gangplank and back to the shore. He shoved people from his path, feeling the old anger and intemperance surging within him. A moment more, and he was at the little girl\'92s side.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Her mother looked up at him, her face stained with frightened and helpless tears. \'93Can you help her? Please, can you help her?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The little girl was no more than six or seven, hardly older than one of Mat\'92s sisters the last time Darrick had seen her.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93Ain\'92t no good,\'94 a man nearby whispered. \'93Seen people all squashed up like this before. That little girl\'92s as good as dead, she is.\'94

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Without a word, Darrick placed his hands on the girl\'92s body, feeling the broken bones shifting within her.\plain \f2\i\fs24 Please,\plain \f2\fs24 he thought, ignoring Kabraxis\'92s harsh whispers fouling the back of his mind. He wouldn\'92t let the demon\'92s words come forward, wouldn\'92t allow himself to understand them.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Power flowed through Darrick\'92s hands, pouring into the little girl. A long moment passed, then her body arched suddenly, and she stopped breathing. During that still moment, Darrick felt certain that Kabraxis had somehow betrayed him, had somehow made him cause the girl\'92s death instead of preventing it.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Then the girl opened her eyes, the clearest blue eyes Darrick thought he\'92d ever seen. She called for her mother and reached for her. The woman took up her child and hugged her to her breast fiercely.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93A healer,\'94 someone whispered.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93That\'92s not just a healer,\'94 someone else said. \'93He brought her back from the dead, he did. That little girl weren\'92t nothin\'92 more than a corpse, an\'92 he done brung her back like it was nothin\'92.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick pushed himself to his feet, suddenly ringed in by people who were curious and suspicious of him. He put his hand on his sword, barely resisting the impulse to draw the weapon and clear the path from him. In the back of his mind, he heard the demon laugh.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Taramis was suddenly at Darrick\'92s side, as were Rhambal and Palat. \'93Come on,\'94 the sage urged.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Was this what Kabraxis wanted? Darrick wondered. Would his death at the hands of a lynch mob allow the demon to step back into the world of men? Darrick didn\'92t know.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The mother rose to his defense, holding her child to her. \'93Don\'92t you men dare touch him. He brought my little Jenna back to me.

\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  \'93The Wayfinder was leading you to demons,\'94 Taramis said. \'93If he had not killed the servant of the false Prophet of the Light, all of you would have been doomed to the Burning Hells.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Darrick felt sickened. He was no hero, and he was no saint. He forced himself to release his tight hold on Stormfury.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  Grudgingly, the lynch mob mentality gave way, surrendering to the people who were looking for something to make sense out of all they had been through with the Church of the Prophet of the Light.
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  In amazement, Darrick watched as people came forward with wounded friends and family, beseeching him to heal them. He turned to Taramis. \'93What do I do?\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0  The sage gazed at him. \'93The choice is yours. You can board that ship and tend to your own needs as best you can, or you can stay here in this moment and tend the needs of others.\'94
\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0

Just as steel must be tempered, Darrick, so must a man. You\'92ve come a long way. Your present is balanced between your past and the dreams you might have. You stand between the Light and the Dark as Kabraxis\'92s gateway, but it is your choice to remain open or closed. Your choice to hide the power or to use it. You can fear it or embrace it.

Then, taking a deep breath, he went forward to meet his future, his head high, no one\'92s unloved bastard child anymore but a man of compassion and conviction.
